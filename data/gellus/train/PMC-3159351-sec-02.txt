Materials and Methods:
A total of 75 brain abscess pus specimens were collected during neurosurgery, either by burr hole or by craniotomy. These specimens were further subjected to Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, and conventional microbiological culture. Only those cases which showed presence of AFB on ZN stain along with the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were considered as TBAs. Such TBA cases were further presented along with their In vitro Proton Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopic findings.

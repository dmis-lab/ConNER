Pancreatic somatostatin-secreting gangliocytic paraganglioma with lymph node metastases. 
Gangliocytic paraganglioma (GPG) with local lymph node metastasis was found in the pancreas of a 74-yr-old female who presented with diarrhea, steatorrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. A Whipple procedure led to a complete resolution of these symptoms and a return of an elevated stomatostatin level to normal. This is the first description of GPG in this location and the first endocrinologically active GPG.

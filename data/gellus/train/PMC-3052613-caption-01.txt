Modified radiology-guided percutaneous gastrostomy technique.
A. 21G fine needle punctured localized collection of air, which was visible in collapsed stomach under fluoroscopy-guided gastrostomy. Needle tip is then gradually withdrawn while injecting small amounts of water-soluble contrast medium. Location of stomach is confirmed by visualization of opacified gastric rugae. B. Stomach was inflated with approximately 600-800 mL of room air through 21G fine needle. C. 100-cm stainless steel guide wire is inserted through needle, and gastro-percutaneous tract is gradually dilated. D. Insertion of 14-Fr pigtail gastrostomy catheter and injection of small amount of water-soluble contrast medium via pigtail catheter confirmed that gastrostomy catheter is correctly placed within stomach.

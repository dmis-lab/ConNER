Phosphatidyl serine exposure during apoptosis precedes release of cytochrome c and decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential.
Time kinetics of phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure were compared to other apoptotic parameters following different apoptotic stimuli. Our data indicate that anti-Fas treatment of L929sAhFas cells results in rapid exposure of PS, which precedes decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and release of cytochrome c, indicating that PS exposure occurs independently of these mitochondrial events. Also during TNF-, etoposide- or staurosporine-mediated apoptosis in PC60 RI/RII cells, PS-positive cells were observed before they had a decreased DeltaPsi(m). However, during growth factor depletion-induced death of 32D cells, both phenomena seemed to occur at the same time.

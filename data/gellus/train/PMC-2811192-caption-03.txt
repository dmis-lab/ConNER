Electrostatic interaction energies between the SNARE complex and fusing membranes.
(A) Schematic diagram and definitions of intermolecular interaction energies presented in (B) and (C). In (A) through (C), only the SNARE core complex is considered. Interaction free energies are calculated for (B) a series of SNARE/membrane distances and (C) different membrane lipid compositions. Arrow in (B) indicates the most physiologically relevant distance when the closest points between SNARE and membranes are 3 A, the thickness of a layer of water.[19] In (D) through (F), TMDs of VAMP and syntaxin are present and embedded in membranes. Furthermore, the C-terminus of the SNARE motif is partially unraveled into individual alpha-helices by molecular dynamics simulations to represent trans-SNARE complex. Interaction free energies are then calculated for (E) a series of SNARE motif C-terminus separation distances and (F) different lipid compositions of the membranes. Conclusions drawn from both groups of studies are essentially the same. V (circles): Interaction energies between the SNARE complex and the v-membrane. T (squares): Interaction energies between SNARE and the t-membrane. VT (triangles): Interaction energies between the v- and the t-membranes if the SNARE complex were extracted.

Inhibition of glucose metabolism sensitizes tumor cells to death receptor-triggered apoptosis through enhancement of death-inducing signaling complex formation and apical procaspase-8 processing. 
Tumors display a high rate of glucose uptake and glycolysis. We investigated how inhibition of glucose metabolism could affect death receptor-mediated apoptosis in human tumor cells of diverse origin. We show that both substitution of glucose for pyruvate and treatment with 2-deoxyglucose enhanced apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, CD95 agonistic antibody, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Inhibition of glucose metabolism enhanced killing of myeloid leukemia U937, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells upon death receptor ligation. Caspase activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytochrome c release were increased under these conditions. Glucose deprivation-mediated sensitization to apoptosis was prevented in MCF-7 cells overexpressing BCL-2. Interestingly, the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4, a prototype for mitochondria-independent death receptor-induced apoptosis, was also sensitized to anti-CD95 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis under glucose-free conditions. Changes in c-FLIP(L) and cFLIPs levels were observed in some but not all the cell lines studied following glucose deprivation. Glucose deprivation enhanced death receptor-triggered formation of death-inducing signaling complex and early processing of procaspase-8. Altogether, these results suggest that the glycolytic pathway may be an important target for therapeutic intervention to sensitize tumor cells to selectively toxic soluble death ligands or death ligand-expressing cells of the immune system by facilitating the activation of initiator caspase-8.

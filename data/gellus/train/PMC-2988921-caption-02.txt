Selective SMA angiography was performed 5 h from onset. Before therapy, the SMA was completely occluded by an embolus at the proximal portion (a), and after the bolus infusion of urokinase (600,000 IU) into the SMA, peripheral blood flow was improved. However, the thrombus decreased in size, but remained (b). Asterisks indicate thrombus.

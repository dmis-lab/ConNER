Fluoro-Jade B staining following zymosan microinjection into the spinal cord white matter.
1. The fluorescein derivate Fluoro-Jade B (FJB), which primarily labels dead or dying neurons, was used to study the acute focal inflammation in the spinal cord white matter. Inflammation was induced by microinjection of the yeast particulate zymosan to evaluate the biological effects of intraspinal macrophages activation without the confounding effects of physical trauma. 2. A single bolus of zymosan (Sigma, 75 nL) was stereotaxically injected at the thoracic level into the lateral white matter of rat spinal cord. A standard Fluoro-Jade B staining protocol was applied to spinal cord sections at 6, 12, 24 h and 2, 4 days postinjection. Neutral Red, NADPH-diaphorase, Iba1-IR, and DAPI staining protocols accomplished examination of the cells participating in the acute inflammatory response. 3. Zymosan caused formation of clearly delineated inflammation lesions localized in the lateral white matter of the spinal cord. Fluoro-Jade B stained cells in the area of inflammation were not observed at 12 h postinjection while mild FJB staining appeared at 24 h and intense staining was observed at 2 and 4 days postinjection. 4. This study shows that the acute response to zymosan-induced inflammation in the rat spinal cord white matter causes a gradual appearance of phagocytic microglia/macrophages and delayed FJB staining of the inflammatory cells. 5. FJB, a reliable marker of dying neurons, is a more universal agent than formerly believed. One possible explanation for the gradual appearance of FJB-stained cells in the area of inflammation is that specific time is required for sufficient levels of proteins and/or myelin debris of axonal origin to appear in the cytoplasm of phagocytic microglia/macrophages.

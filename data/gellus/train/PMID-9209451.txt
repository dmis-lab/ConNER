Monitoring the efficiency of interferon-alpha therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients by competitive polymerase chain reaction.
Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) induces cytogenetic responses of variable degree in patients with CML. We sought to establish the relationship between BCR-ABL transcript numbers measured by competitive two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cytogenetic status in CML patients treated with IFN-alpha. All 398 samples from 163 patients investigated by RT-PCR were positive for BCR-ABL transcripts. In order to standardize results for variability in RNA and cDNA quality, we quantified total ABL transcripts in each sample as internal control. The BCR-ABL/ABL ratios correlated with the cytogenetic results. Quantitative nested PCR allowed the detection of residual BCR-ABL transcripts in all complete cytogenetic responders on IFN-alpha. We conclude that competitive PCR with internal controls is a reliable method for monitoring patients on IFN-alpha and reduces the need for repeated marrow investigations.

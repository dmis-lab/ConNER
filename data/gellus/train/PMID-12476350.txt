CXC chemokine receptors in the central nervous system: Role in cerebellar neuromodulation and development.
Chemokines and their receptors are constitutively present in the central nervous system (CNS), expressed in neurons and glial cells. Much evidence suggests that, beyond their involvement in neuroinflammation, these proteins play a role in neurodevelopment and neurophysiological signaling. The goal of this review is to summarize recent information concerning expression, signaling, and function of CXC chemokine receptor in the CNS, with the main focus on the developmental and neuromodulatory actions of chemokines in the cerebellum.

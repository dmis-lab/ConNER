Scheme of the activity of 5-HT (A) and norepinephrine (NE) (B) neurotransmission during treatment with milnacipran. A) 5-HT system. Acute treatment with milnacipran results in a decreased firing of 5-HT neurons from the raphe nucleus possibly due in part to increased stimulation of somatodendritic autoreceptors. Long-term treatment with milnacipran results in a full recovery in the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the presence of milnacipran thereby leading to a net increase in 5-HT neurotransmission. Contributing to this enhancement are: 1) the normalized firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the presence of milnacipran 2) the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor, and 3) the desensitization of the alpha2-adrenergic heteroreceptors on 5-HT terminals. B) NE system. Acute treatment with milnacipran results in increased synaptic concentrations of NE but decreased firing of the NE neurons of the locus coeruleus due to increased stimulation of the somatodendritic alpha2-adrenergic autoreceptors. Long-term treatment with milnacipran results in a further increase in synaptic concentrations of NE due to desensitization of presynaptic autoreceptors. The somatodendritic alpha2-adrenergic autoreceptors do not desensitize.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
For this study, 20 individuals (mean age 39.5 +/- 11.1 years) with long-standing type 1 diabetes (21.3 +/- 10.7 years) were enrolled in this prospective open-label crossover trial. After achieving optimal blood glucose control, 16 subjects were randomized to exenatide with or without daclizumab. Endogenous insulin production was determined by repeatedly measuring serum C-peptide.

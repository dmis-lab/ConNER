SWAP-70 is required for oncogenic transformation by v-Src in mouse embryo fibroblasts. 
SWAP-70 is a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)) binding protein, which acts in F-actin rearrangement. The role of SWAP-70 in oncogenic transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) by v-Src was examined by use of MEFs defective in SWAP-70. v-Src morphologically transformed MEFs lacking SWAP-70, but growth of the transformed cells in culture was slower than that of cells supplemented with exogenous SWAP-70. The v-Src-transformed MEFs deficient in SWAP-70 were unable to grow in soft agar while those expressing SWAP70 readily formed colonies, suggesting that SWAP-70 is required for anchorage independent growth of v-Src transformed MEFs. When transplanted in nude mice, tumors formed by the v-Src transformed SWAP-70(-/-) MEFs were smaller than those formed by cells expressing exogenous SWAP-70. These results suggest that SWAP-70 may be required for oncogenic transformation and contributes to cell growth in MEFs transformed by v-Src.

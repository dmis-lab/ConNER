Intervention
Patients' initial introduction to the Wrist Extension Dynasplint (WED) system, [Dynasplint Systems, Inc., Severna Park, MD, USA] included customized fitting (wrist length, width, and girth so that the force and counter force straps could be properly aligned) and training on donning and doffing of the device. (See figure 1.) Verbal and written instructions were provided throughout the duration of treatment for safety, general wear and care, and tension setting goals based on patient tolerance.

Each patient initially wore the WED for 4-6 continuous hours at an initial tension setting of #2 (0.1 foot pounds of torque). This duration was for acclimatization to the system; then patients were instructed to wear the WED system at night while sleeping for 6-8 hours of continuous wear. After each patient was comfortable wearing the unit for one week at tension level #2, they were instructed to increase the tension level to #3 (0.3 ft lbs.) and make continual increases every two weeks. If prolonged soreness followed a session (soreness for more than 15 minutes) the patient was instructed to decrease the tension one half a setting for two days until they were comfortable wearing it for 6-8 hours at the new tension setting. The majority of all patients reached level #5 (0.8 foot pounds of torque) by the end of two months. All range of motion measurements were recorded by the prescribing clinician.

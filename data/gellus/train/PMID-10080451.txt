Ventricular fibrillation due to long QT syndrome probably caused by clindamycin.
Prolongation of QT time interval may be provoked by a limited number of drugs, especially macrolide antibiotics. We describe a case of QT time interval prolongation induced by clindamycin with subsequent repeated ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation; there is no previous report in the literature of QT time prolongation caused by lincosamides.

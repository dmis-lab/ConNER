The thickness of the inner retina was established as the distance between retinal nerve fiber layer and inner nuclear layer and was measured using the 1,000 mum caliper available in the OCT-SLO Spectralis. Ten age-matched normal eyes were used as controls. Observe the decrease in the nasal and temporal inner retinal thickness in the right eye in comparison to the left and normal control eyes.

Calcium intake and effects on QUS T-score
Figure 5 shows the amounts of dietary calcium intake according to menopausal status. Calcium consumption in most groups, like that in the study population as a whole, was inadequate. Fewer than one third of premenopausal and postmenopausal women received more than 800 mg calcium daily, and fewer than 16% of premenopausal women in the 50-59 age decade (n = 38) consumed more than 800 mg calcium daily.

Daily calcium intake in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. This figure depicts the daily amounts of dietary calcium intake (and percent) according to menopausal status using 800 mg daily as cut off point.
QUS T-score were then calculated according to daily calcium intake in all premenopausal and postmenopausal activity groups using 800 mg daily calcium as cutoff point. As shown in Tables 3 and 4 and Figure 6, premenopausal women who were systematically active and consumed more than 800 mg calcium daily had significantly higher QUS T-scores compared with all other activity groups (p < 0.05). Among systematically active premenopausal women who received more than 800 mg calcium per day, this difference was separately significant verses sedentary (p = 0.028) and moderately active (p = 0.04) women. In contrast, postmenopausal women showed no difference in QUS T-scores regardless of the amount of daily calcium intake.

Synergy between physical activity and dietary calcium intake in women consuming calcium amounts greater than 800 mg/day. This graphic depicts mean QUS T-score values calculated according to daily calcium intake in all premenopausal and postmenopausal activity groups using 800 mg daily as cut off point (for statistical significant values see text).

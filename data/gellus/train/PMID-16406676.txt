Regulation of tumor angiogenesis by thrombospondin-1.
Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and metastasis of tumors. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, and down-regulation of TSP-1 has been suggested to alter tumor growth by modulating angiogenesis in a variety of tumor types. Expression of TSP-1 is up-regulated by the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and down-regulated by oncogenes such as Myc and Ras. TSP-1 inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cell migration and proliferation and by inducing apoptosis. In addition, activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) by TSP-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of tumor progression. An understanding of the molecular basis of TSP-1-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor progression will aid in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.

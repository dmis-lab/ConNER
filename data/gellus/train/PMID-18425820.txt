Isotype-specific inhibitors of the glycolytic key regulator pyruvate kinase subtype M2 moderately decelerate tumor cell proliferation. 
Tumor cells express the glycolytic regulator pyruvate kinase subtype M2 (M2-PK), which can occur in a tetrameric form with high affinity to its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and a dimeric form with a low PEP affinity. The transition between both conformations contributes to the control of glycolysis and is important for tumor cell proliferation and survival. Here we targeted M2-PK by synthetic peptide aptamers, which specifically bind to M2-PK and shift the isoenzyme into its low affinity dimeric conformation. The aptamer-induced dimerization and inactivation of M2-PK led to a significant decrease in the PK mass-action ratio as well as ATP:ADP ratio in the target cells. Furthermore, the expression of M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers moderately reduced the growth of immortalized NIH3T3 cell populations by decelerating cell proliferation, but without affecting apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers also reduced the proliferation rate of human U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. In the present study, we developed the first specific inhibitors of the pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 and present evidence that these inhibitors moderately decelerate tumor cell proliferation.

Morphogenesis of embryonic CNS vessels.
This chapter focuses on the morphology of blood vessel formation in and around the early central nervous system (CNS, i.e., brain and spinal cord) of avian embryos. We discuss cell lineages, proliferation and interactions of endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells, and macrophages. Due to space limitations, we can not review the molecular control of CNS angiogenesis, but refer the reader to other chapters in this book and to recent publications on the assembly of the vasculature (1,2).

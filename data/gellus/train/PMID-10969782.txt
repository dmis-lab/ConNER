Caspase-3 is essential for procaspase-9 processing and cisplatin-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 
In this study, we sought to investigate in more detail the role of caspase-3 in apoptotic processes in cultured cells and in cell-free extracts of breast cancer cells. We present evidence that apoptosis of caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cells is defective in response to cisplatin treatment, as determined by chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, DNA fragmentation, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Reconstitution of MCF-7 cells by stable transfection of CASP-3 cDNA restores all these defects and results in an extensive apoptosis after cisplatin treatment. We further show that in extracts from caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, procaspase-9 processing is strongly impaired after stimulation with either cytochrome c or recombinant caspase-8. Reconstitution of MCF-7 cell extracts with procaspase-3 corrects this defect, resulting in an efficient and complete processing of procaspase-9. Together, our data define caspase-3 as an important integrator of the apoptotic process in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and reveal an essential function of caspase-3 for procaspase-9 processing.

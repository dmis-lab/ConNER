Anion to cation selectivity ratio determined from the relative rates of reaction of MTSES- and MTSET+ with the water exposed residues in the M6 segment. The anion selectivity ratio is calculated as described in Table II, column 5. Note the marked increase in anion selectivity at the residues T351C and Q353C. A ratio of 1 indicates no selectivity between anions and cations. The larger the ratio the greater the anion selectivity.

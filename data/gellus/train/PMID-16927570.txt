[The prevalence of ADHD and attention problems in preschool-aged children. A comparison of two diagnostic instruments].
OBJECTIVES:
In order to analyse the prevalence of ADHD and attention problems in preschool-aged children, mothers were asked to rate their children using two measuring instruments.
METHODS:
The analysis is part of a prospective, randomised control study of N = 280 children aged three to six years, whose mothers rated them using the Child Behaviour Checklist/CBCL 1 1/2-5 and the Parent Rating Scale for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
RESULTS:
The prevalence rates ranged from 2.7% to 9.9%. There was no significant gender effect in this age group.
CONCLUSIONS:
The study delivers initial findings and provides support for decisions to implement in Germany new assessment methods for preschool-aged children with ADHD or hyperkinetic syndrome. Finally, the different rates of prevalence and the implications of the findings for epidemiology and the prevention of ADHD and attention problems among preschool-aged children are discussed.

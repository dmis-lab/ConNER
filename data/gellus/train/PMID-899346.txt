[Considerations regarding two cases of macromastia (author's transl)].
Two cases of macromastia have been shown; one which appeared during puberty, the other during menopause. Histopathological examination has demonstrated for the both cases a cystic degeneracy of the glandular tissue with a hyperplazia and hypertrophy of the conjunctive tissue. The pathogeny of macromastia is being discussed and it is demonstrated both the role of hypophysis hormones (prolactine and growth hormone) and of ovarian hormones (estrogens). The treatment was surgical for the both cases.

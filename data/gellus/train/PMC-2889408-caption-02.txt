The eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma brucei is able to import inositol from the environment or synthesize it de novo. However, according to the current model, inositol imported from the environment is utilized primarily in bulk phosphatidylinositol (red and yellow phospholipid) production via a phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) localized to the Golgi complex. Inositol synthesized de novo is primarily used to generate phosphatidylinositol that is used for production of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs). The de novo-synthesized inositol is believed to be utilized mostly for GPI production because the IMPase that dephosphorylates inositol 3-phosphate to inositol is localized to the ER, where GPI synthesis occurs. Mutants lacking TbINO1 are inviable because of diminished GPI production.

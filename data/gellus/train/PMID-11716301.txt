Assembly strategies and GTPase regulation of the eukaryotic and Escherichia coil translocons.
The translocation of most proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum or bacterial inner membrane occurs through an aqueous pore that spans the membrane. Substrates that are translocated co-translationally across the membrane are directed to the translocation pore via an interaction between the cytosolic signal recognition particle and its membrane-bound receptor. Together the translocation pore and the receptor are referred to as a translocon. By studying the biogenesis of the translocon a number of alternate targeting and membrane-integration pathways have been discovered that operate independently of the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. The novel assembly strategies of the translocon and the ways in which these components interact to ensure the fidelity and unidirectionality of the targeting and translocation process are reviewed here.

Glutamine and glucose as energy substrates for Ehrlich ascites tumour cells.
Energy metabolism of freshly harvested Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in the presence of 5 mM glucose and/or 0.5 mM glutamine was studied. The rate of oxygen utilization was not altered by the addition of 0.5 mM glutamine; 5 mM glucose induced an inhibition of respiration. In the presence of both glucose and glutamine, the Crabtree effect decreased. In these conditions, the rates of oxygen uptake, the CO2 evolution and the changes in the redox states of cytochromes indicate that glucose is preferred by Ehrlich ascites tumour cells as energy substrate. Glucose decreased the rate of glutamine utilization by 34%. On the other hand, glutaminolysis did not inhibit glycolysis.

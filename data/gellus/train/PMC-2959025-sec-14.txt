Histology of the lung
The left lung was fixed by gentle infusion of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde) through the tracheal cannula [24]. After excision, the lung was immersed in a fresh fixative for 2 h. The lung lobe was embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 mum transverse sections, followed by immunohistochemical and chemical staining. Photomicrographs were captured using KS400 image analyze platform (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analyzed quantitatively.

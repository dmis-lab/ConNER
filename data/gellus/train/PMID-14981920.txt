Effect of antitumor agents on cytotoxicity induction by sodium fluoride.
We have recently found that sodium fluoride (NaF) induced apoptotic cell death in tumor cell lines. We investigated here whether 6 popular antitumor compounds modify the cytotoxic activity of NaF against human squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell lines. Cytotoxic concentrations of cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin or peplomycin (tentatively termed as Group I compounds), but not methotrexate and 5-FU (tentatively termed as Group II compounds), enhanced the cytotoxic activity of NaF. NaF and Group I compounds induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells, whereas Group II compounds were inactive even in the presence of NaF. Most Group I compounds except doxorubicin (which induced DNA fragmentation less effectively than others) activated caspase 3 more efficiently than Group II compounds. Caspase 8 (involved in non-mitochondrial extrinsic pathway) and caspase 9 (involved in mitochondrial intrinsic pathway) were also activated, but to a much lesser extent. NaF reduced the glucose consumption at early stage, possibly by inhibition of glycolysis, whereas cisplatin and etoposide reduced the glucose consumption at later stage, suggesting that early decline of glucose consumption is rather specific to NaF.

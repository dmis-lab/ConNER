[Uncommon etiology of gastrointestinal bleeding: duodenal metastases from renal cell carcinoma].
Because of its unpredictable behavior, renal cell carcinoma is one of the most controversial neoplasms. On the one hand, patients frequently show metastases at diagnosis because of its slight manifestations, while on the other, the neoplasm can remain stable after nephrectomy and can then metastasize many years later. When this happens, the metastases usually involve more than 2 organs. The most frequent sites of metastases are the lung and lymph nodes, followed by the bones and liver, while duodenal involvement is rare. Indeed, intestinal metastases are found in only 2% of autopsies and of these, renal cell carcinoma metastases account for 7.1%. We present a case of a solitary late recurrence presenting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding 19 years after nephrectomy for clear cell renal carcinoma.

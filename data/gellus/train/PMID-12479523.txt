Combined tracheal and esophageal stenting for palliation of tracheoesophageal symptoms from mediastinal lymphoma.
Mediastinal lymphoma as a cause of tracheobronchial obstruction is uncommon, and a malignant tracheoesophageal fistula in the setting of mediastinal lymphoma is rare. Malignant tracheoesophageal fistulas are associated with pronounced morbidity and mortality. We describe a patient with mediastinal lymphomatous infiltration resulting in tracheal obstruction, esophageal obstruction, and tracheoesophageal fistula that were successfully palliated with combined airway and esophageal stent placement.

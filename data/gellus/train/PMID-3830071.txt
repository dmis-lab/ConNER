Clinical evaluation of radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.
Seventeen patients with moderately severe ophthalmopathy due to Graves' disease were treated by cobalt or supervoltage radiotherapy. All patients complained of diplopia. The mean proptosis value was 21.4 mm. Three patients (18%) showed good response, 7 (41%) moderate and 7 minimal or no response. Improvement was noted mainly in soft tissue changes and diplopia, while proptosis decreased in only 5 patients. All except one patient who had marked extraocular muscle involvement revealed by computed tomography responded to treatment. These data indicate that radiotherapy may be indicated in patients with progressive ophthalmopathy, especially in those who are associated with extraocular muscle enlargement.

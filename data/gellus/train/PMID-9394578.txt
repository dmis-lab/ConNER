[Extra-anatomic bypass from the ascending aorta to the supraceliac abdominal aorta--surgical option applied to reoperation for aortic coarctation or interruption].
The optimal approach for reoperation following repair of aortic coarctation (CoA) or interruption (IAA) remains controversial. Four patients underwent extra-anatomic bypass for restenosis after repair of CoA or IAA. The age ranged from 4 to 12 years. The initial repairs for two CoA, one type A-IAA, and one type B-IAA consisted of two grafting, one subclavian arterial turning-down aortoplasty, and one subclavian flap aortoplasty. All of them underwent during infancy. Preoperative right arm systolic pressure ranged from 140 to 190 mmHg ar rest. Through a midline sternotomy and an upper laparotmy incision, an extra-anatomic bypass from the ascending aorta to the supraceliac abdominal aorta was employed using a 12 to 18 mm tube graft. All patients survived surgeries, and their hypertension markedly improved. Our experience confirms safety and effectiveness of this option in selected young patients with re-stenosis of following repair of CoA or IAA.

Selective inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB by nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator-binding domain peptide suppresses the metastasis of highly metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma. 
Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation contributes to the development of metastasis, thus leading to a poor prognosis in many cancers, including OSCC. However, little in vivo experimental data are available about the effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on OSCC metastasis. OSCC sublines were established from a GFP-expressing parental cell line, GSAS, and designated GSAS/N3 and N5 according to the in vivo passage number after cervical lymph node metastasis by a serial orthotopic transplantation model. In vitro migration and invasion were assessed in these cells, and the NF-kappaB activities and expression of NF-kappaB-regulated metastasis-related molecules were also examined. In in vivo experiments, the metastasis and survival of tumor-engrafted mice were monitored. Furthermore, the effects of a selective NF-kappaB inhibitor, NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide, on metastasis in GSAS/N5-engrafted mice were assessed, and engrafted tongue tumors were immunohistochemically examined. Highly metastatic GSAS/N3 and N5 cells showed an enhanced NF-kappaB activity, thus contributing to increased migration, invasion, and a poor prognosis compared with the parent cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of NF-kappaB-regulated metastasis-related molecules, such as fibronectin, beta1 integrin, MMP-1, -2, -9, and -14, and VEGF-C, were upregulated in the highly metastatic cells. The NBD peptide suppressed metastasis and tongue tumor growth in GSAS/N5-inoculated mice, and was accompanied by the downregulation of the NF-kappaB-regulated metastasis-related molecules in engrafted tongue tumors. Our results suggest that the selective inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by NBD peptide may provide an effective approach for the treatment of highly metastatic OSCC.

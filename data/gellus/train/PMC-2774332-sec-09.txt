Target volumes' coverage
The mean PTV1 and PTV2 volumes were 452 cm3 (range 276-1074 cm3) and 300 cm3 (range 137-567 cm3) respectively. A mean of >98% (range 92-100%) of the PTV1 received 100% of the prescribed dose in all planning methods. A mean of 95.5% and 95.7% of the PTV2 received 100% of the prescribed dose with TOMO and IMRT plans respectively. A mean of 94% and 92% of the PTV2 received 100% of the prescribed dose with IB and 3D treatment plans, respectively. The mean IB and 3D plans PTV2 coverage was significantly inferior then the IMRT and TOMO plans (p < 0.02, for all comparisons).
The mean Inhomogeneity Coefficient (IC) was significantly lower (better) with the TOMO plans, compared to all other plans for both PTV1 and PTV2 (p < 0.0003 for all comparisons) (figure 3). The mean IC of the IMRT plans was significantly higher (worse) than the mean IC of the 3D plans regarding PTV 1 (p < 0.02) and higher (worse) then the mean IC of the IB plans regarding PTV2 (p < 0.03) (figure 3). No significant difference was found between the means of the IC of the 3D and IB plans.

The mean Inhomogeneity Coefficient (IC) achieved by the different planning methods. The mean of the Inhomogeneity Coefficient is a measure of dose inhomogeneity in the target volumes. The closer the IC to zero, the more homogenous the dose is.

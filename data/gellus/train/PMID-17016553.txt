Imaging tumor angiogenesis.
Since the discovery of vascular-specific growth factors with angiogenic activity, there has been a significant effort to develop cancer drugs that restrict tumorigenesis by targeting the blood supply. In this issue of the JCI, Mancuso et al. use mouse models to better understand the plasticity of the tumor vasculature in the face of antiangiogenic therapy (see the related article beginning on page 2610). They describe a rapid regrowth of the tumor vasculature following withdrawal of VEGFR inhibitors, emphasizing the importance of fully understanding the function of these and similar treatments used in the clinic at the cellular and molecular level.

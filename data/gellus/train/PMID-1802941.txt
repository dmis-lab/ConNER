M. leprae- and BCG-induced chemiluminescence response of monocytes from leprosy patients and healthy subjects: effects of gamma-interferon and GM-CSF.
Mycobacterium leprae, in contrast to BCG, failed to trigger any chemiluminescence (CL) response in mononuclear cells from either leprosy patients or healthy subjects, a deficit not reversed by either interferon-gamma or GM-CSF. Chemiluminescence responses induced without mycobacteria or with BCG were found to be lower in leprosy patients than in controls. M. leprae were also less well phagocytosed than BCG. However, there was a significant difference in phagocytosis between healthy and tuberculoid leprosy subjects. Phagocytosis was not altered by the addition of either lymphokine, and no major differences between healthy subjects and patients were observed. Preincubating mononuclear cells with anti-mycobacteria antibodies (lepromatous patients' sera) did not increase the CL response nor the phagocytosis of M. leprae or BCG.

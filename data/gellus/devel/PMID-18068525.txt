FAS -1377 G/A polymorphism and the risk of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the FAS -1377G/A, FAS -670A/G, and FASL -844T/C genes may alter transcriptional activity of these genes. Recent evidence suggests an association of these polymorphisms with an increased risk of cervical cancer, so we explored this relationship. Genotypes of 155 patients with cervical cancer and 160 healthy control subjects were determined using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Associations with cancer risk were estimated using two-sided logistic regression. We observed a significantly increased risk of lymph node metastasis associated with the FAS -1377 GA or AA polymorphism [odds ratio (OR) = 4.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 15.74; P = 0.036]. In addition, the FAS -670AG or GG genotype showed an increased incidence of node metastasis, but these findings were not statistically significant (OR = 3.67, 95% CI = 0.96-14.00, P = 0.059). There was no significant association between an increased risk of cervical cancer and polymorphisms of the death pathway genes FAS and FASL. None of the polymorphisms were associated with risk of advanced stage or histologic subtype of cervical cancer. In conclusion, FAS -1377 G-->A polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastasis in Korean cervical cancer patients.

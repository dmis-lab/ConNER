Quantitative sequencing of complex mixtures of heterochitooligosaccharides by vMALDI-linear ion trap mass spectrometry.
Heterochitooligosaccharides possess interesting biological properties. Isobaric mixtures of such linear heterochitooligosaccharides can be obtained by chemical or enzymatic degradation of chitosan. However, the separation of such mixtures is a challenging analytical problem which is so far unresolved. It is shown that these isobaric mixtures can be sequenced and quantified simultaneously using standard derivatization and multistage tandem mass spectrometric techniques. A linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a vacuum matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (vMALDI) source is used to perform MS2 as well as MS3 experiments.

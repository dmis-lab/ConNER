Conservative treatment of endometriosis: the effects of limited surgery and hormonal pseudopregnancy.
This study compares the effects of limited surgery or hormonal pseudopregnancy, or a combination of these two, upon fertility and the need for subsequent surgery with respect to the extent of the disease at the time of initial diagnosis in patients with endometriosis externa. Of the 61 patients who desired to enhance or preserve reproductive capacity, 20 patients became pregnant, for a pregnancy rate of 33%. The pregnancy rate in all categories, that is, those patients treated with pseudopregnancy, conservative surgery, and combined pseudopregnancy and surgery, was found to be in direct relationship to the initial extent of disease. In such patients, conservative surgery alone seemed to give the best results in the achievement of pregnancy. There seemed to be little difference between pseudopregnancy alone and conservative surgery in regard to the need for subsequent surgery after initial therapy, although there seemed to be a significantly greater chance for the need for subsequent surgery in patients receiving a combination of the two forms of therapy. The need for subsequent surgery after initial therapy in 80 patients increased in direct relationship to the initial extent of disease present, despite the form of therapy used. Fifty-nine other patients with endometriosis, who did not desire to preserve fertility and presented for relief of other symptoms, underwent initial "radical" therapy. Forty-six patients underwent complete operation, including removal of uterus, tubes and ovaries, and none required subsequent reoperation. Of the 13 remaining patients, who underwent incomplete surgical removal, leaving one or both ovaries in situ, 11 required subsequent reoperation for recurrent pelvic endometriosis.

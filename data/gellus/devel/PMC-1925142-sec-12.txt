Results
Here we include data obtained from active, oscillatory brain slices as well as from recordings during cortical slow oscillations in anesthetized animals. All recordings included in this study were obtained from the visual cortex of the ferret (in vitro), cat (in vivo) and from barrel cortex of the rat (in vivo). Twenty-nine neurons recorded from ferret cortical slices are included in this study (22 regular spiking (RS); 5 chattering (CH) and 2 intrinsic bursting (IB)), 27 neurons from cat visual cortex in vivo (14 RS; 5 CH; 2 IB; 3 fast spiking (FS); plus 3 non classified) and 14 neurons from rat barrel cortex in vivo (12 RS; 1 CH; 1 IB). Synaptic potentials were evoked by electric shocks (intracortical or thalamocortical connections) or by means of sensory (visual or whisker) stimulation. The main results are: 1) Synaptic potentials show more paired pulsed facilitation and synaptic augmentation in active than in silent cortical networks and 2) Synaptic potentials occurring during up or activated states of the cortex increased their amplitude with respect to those occurring during down states.

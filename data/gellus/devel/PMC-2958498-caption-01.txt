The right eye of a 50-year-old patient with severe hypertension at the first visit. (a) Fundus photograph shows serous retinal detachment. The optic disc is pale at the temporal side. (b) Optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows retinal detachment involving the fovea and cystic change of inner retina. (c) Early phase images of fluorescein angiography (FA) (left) and indocyanine green angiography (IA) (right). (d) Late phase images of FA (left) and IA (right). FA shows window defect associated with macular cystic change. Note that no active leakage is observed in the area with serous retinal detachment or cystoid edema. IA shows decreased perfusion of the choroid at the macula and window defect with the damaged RPE. Hypofluorescence (arrow) along the retinal artery are observed. These are unique findings.

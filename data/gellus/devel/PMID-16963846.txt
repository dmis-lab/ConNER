Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia: long-term study.
PURPOSE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia (PM). METHODS: Sixty-two patients (62 eyes) with PM underwent PDT according to the guidelines of the Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy Study. Clinical evaluations performed at all study visits included measurement of best-corrected Snellen visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus fluorescein angiography. Patients were followed up at 1 month and 3 months after treatment and thereafter at 3-month intervals. RESULTS: The final visual acuity of the study patients, after a median follow-up of 31 months, improved by  greater than or=1 Snellen lines in 8 patients (13%), deteriorated in 20 (32%), and remained stable in 34 (55%). The baseline visual acuity was similar in the various study groups. The final mean visual acuity in group A (55 years of age or younger) was 20/80 and significantly (P=0.006) better than that (20/138) in group B (older than 55 years of age). The mean final visual acuity in eyes with higher refractive error at baseline (greater than -17 diopters) was significantly better (P=0.014) than that in eyes with lower refractive error (-6 to -10 diopters). CNV size did not affect visual outcomes. CONCLUSION: PDT preserves vision in patients with CNV associated with PM. Younger patients and eyes with higher refractive error appear more likely to benefit from PDT with verteporfin.

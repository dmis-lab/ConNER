Cognitive function and number of teeth in a community-dwelling elderly population without dementia.
Although the number of sound or decayed teeth has been reported to be associated with cognitive function in elderly populations with dementia, little is known about this association in elderly populations without dementia. We evaluated this relationship, with adjustment for confounding factors, in Japanese populations of 60-year-old (n = 270; 120 males and 150 females) and 65-year-old (n = 123; 57 males and 66 females) individuals residing in Fukuoka Prefecture of Japan. Dental examinations were performed in all subjects, along with the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for assessing cognitive function. Among the total of 393 subjects, the mean MMSE score was 27.9 +/- 1.9, and 391 subjects scored 24 or higher. The mean numbers of sound and decayed teeth were 12.0 +/- 6.3 and 0.5 +/- 1.2, respectively. Associations were found between the numbers of sound and decayed teeth and MMSE in total subjects and males, but not in females, by multiple regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, level of education, marital status, smoking, alcohol drinking, working status, systolic blood pressure and blood glucose. An association was also found between MMSE and the number of sound teeth in a logistic regression analysis. In conclusion, associations were found between normal-range cognitive function and the numbers of sound and decayed teeth, after adjustment for various confounding factors, in an elderly Japanese population.

Retinal microangiopathies overlying pigment epithelial detachment in age-related macular degeneration.
PURPOSE: To evaluate alterations in the retinal vasculature overlying pigment epithelial detachments (PED) in exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) using indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography. METHODS: Forty-one patients (41 eyes) with a clinical diagnosis of exudative ARMD with PED underwent simultaneous fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, also under high (10 degrees ) magnification. Vascular abnormalities in the retina were compared between patients with vascularized (n = 34, group 1) and nonvascularized (n = 7, group 2) PED on indocyanine green angiography and correlated with the size of the PED and the presence of serous retinal detachment. RESULTS: In all, 67 vascular abnormalities were found by indocyanine green angiography and only 22 by fluorescein angiography; this finding was statistically significant (P  less than  0.0001). The finding of retinal vasculopathy (32 patients in group 1 and two patients in group 2) was directly correlated with the presence of choroidal neovascularizations (P = 0.002). There was also a direct correlation between the presence of choroidal neovascularization and size of the PED (P = 0.03). The number of retinal vascular findings was not significantly correlated with serous elevation of the retina. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vasculopathies may be observed in eyes with PED and are detectable by indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography.

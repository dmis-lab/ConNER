Human cytomegalovirus elevates levels of the cellular protein p53 in infected fibroblasts. 
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), like other DNA tumor viruses, induces morphological transformation of cells in vitro and stimulates host cell macromolecular synthesis in infected cells. Since other DNA tumor viruses, such as simian virus 40 and adenovirus, have previously been shown to interact with cellular protein p53, we investigated whether infection of cells by HCMV would modulate cellular p53 levels. Our results indicate that HCMV elevates cellular p53 levels on the order of 10- to 20-fold in infected fibroblasts. The induction of elevated p53 levels was dependent upon the presence of active virus and was prevented by neutralizing antibody. The induction of elevated p53 levels was determined not to be due to virus-receptor interactions or HCMV late events. The induction of elevated p53 levels commenced at immediate-early times of the HCMV multiplication cycle (6 h postinfection) and reached maximal levels by 24 h postinfection, before most of the HCMV DNA synthesis was initiated. HCMV immediate-early proteins were clearly shown to be responsible for elevating p53 levels in infected fibroblasts; expression of HCMV immediate-early region 1 and 2 proteins resulted in elevation of p53 levels in transfected human fibroblasts. This is the first report of increased p53 levels caused by HCMV in infected fibroblasts.

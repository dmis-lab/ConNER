N-myc augments death and attenuates protective effects of Bcl-2 in trophically stressed neuroblastoma cells. 
N-myc has proapoptotic functions, yet it acts as an oncogene in neuroblastoma. Thus, antiapoptotic mechanisms have to be operative in neuroblastoma cells that antagonize the proapoptotic effects of N-myc. We conditionally activated N-myc in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells subjected to the trophic stress of serum or nutrient deprivation while changing the expression of Bcl-2, survivin and FLIP(L), antiapoptotic molecules often overexpressed in poor prognosis neuroblastomas. Bcl-2 protected SH-EP cells from death during nutritional deprivation by activating energetically advantageous oxidative phosphorylation. N-myc overrode the metabolic protection provided by Bcl-2-induced oxidative phosphorylation by reestablishing the glycolytic phenotype and attenuated the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2 during metabolic stress. Survivin partially antagonized the growth suppressive function of N-myc in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells during serum deprivation whereas FLIP(L) did not. These findings advance our understanding of the functions of N-myc in neuroblastoma cells.

Laser treatment of eccentric leaks in central serous chorioretinopathy resulting in disappearance of untreated juxtafoveal leaks.
In central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) laser treatment of leaking points close to the macular center should be avoided because of the possibility of producing juxtafoveal scotoma and stimulating choroidal neovascularization. Nine eyes of nine consecutive patients with CSCR had two or more leaking points within a macular detachment, one of which was foveal or near to the fovea. Photocoagulation with green argon laser was performed in all eyes, treating all the leaking points except for the central one. Visual symptoms regressed after treatment, and the serous detachment was resolved 10 days to 4 weeks after photocoagulation in all cases. Fluorescein angiography showed no leakage at either the central leakage point or the leakage point that had been treated. These results led us to believe that the central or dependent leak in our cases was not sufficient to maintain the serous detachment by itself. An alternative hypothesis is that the untreated leak did not represent real fluid movement but only diffusion of fluorescein molecules, or a false leak. In cases of CSCR with multiple leaks within a single macular detachment, we believe that a foveal leak may be a dependent or false leak and that direct treatment is not necessary.

Protein kinase activities in immune complexes of simian virus 40 large T-antigen and transformation-associated cellular p53 protein. 
Immune complex kinase assays in the simian virus 40 system were performed by incubation of immunoprecipitates containing tumor antigens with [gamma-32P]ATP, followed by analysis of any phosphoacceptor proteins. These assays yielded mainly the viral large T-antigen and, in particular, the associated cellular p53 as endogenous substrates. The nature of these substrates was confirmed by proteolysis techniques. Under specific conditions, casein could be used as an exogenous substrate as well. The kinase reactions showed preference for ATP and MgCl2 instead of GTP or MnCl2. Both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but in no case phosphotyrosine, were detected after an immune complex kinase reaction. Apparently, several in vivo phosphorylation sites were recognized in vitro in both large T-antigen and p53, but the presence of some artifactual sites could not be completely excluded. Although contaminating kinases were detectable in the immune complexes, at least the p53 molecules were phosphorylated in vitro in a more specific way. This followed from several characteristics of the immune complex kinase reactions and especially from the strong inhibition of p53 phosphorylation by two anti-large-T monoclonal antibodies. It was shown that large T-antigen showed associated kinase activity, although none of our results could unambiguously demonstrate an intrinsic kinase activity of this protein. Finally, anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies only slightly affected in vitro phosphorylation reactions, whereas a p53 molecule from a simian virus 40-free, chemically transformed human cell line was not phosphorylated in vitro under any condition tested. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the p53 molecule per se carries intrinsic or even associated kinase activities.

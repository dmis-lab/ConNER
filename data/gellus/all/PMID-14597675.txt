Differential regulation of in vivo angiogenesis by angiotensin II receptors.
Angiotensin II (ANG II), a key regulator of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis, exerts mitogenic effects on endothelial cells. We therefore hypothesized that ANG II could be a mediator between homeostatic changes within the vascular perfusion bed and growth factor-driven angiogenesis. In the present study, we applied the alginate implant angiogenesis model in mice with normal ANG II levels, elevated ANG II levels by transgenic overexpression of angiotensinogen (AOGEN), or in AT2 receptor-deficient mice. We demonstrate that a decrease in the amount of circulating ANG II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril or the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan induced a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis implying an inhibitory function of ANG II through the AT1 receptor. However, the strong increase of angiogenesis in AOGEN-transgenic mice compared with mice with normal ANG II levels suggests additional stimulatory activity. We showed that the ANG II-induced stimulation of angiogenesis is linked to the AT2 receptor as an impaired induction of angiogenesis was obtained in AT2 receptor knockout mice. These findings provide the first evidence that the AT2 receptor mediates a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis and indicate that ANG II is a humoral regulator of peripheral angiogenesis involving two receptor subtypes with opposing actions.

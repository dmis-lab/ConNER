Effect of platelet-rich plasma and fibrin glue on healing of critical-size calvarial bone defects.
Despite the insufficient number of experimental studies, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) including high amounts of growth factors is introduced to clinical use rapidly. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) on healing of critical-size bone defects.Bilateral full-thickness, critical-size bone defects were created in the parietal bones of 32 rabbits, which had been studied in 4 groups. Saline, thrombin solution, PPP, and PRP were applied to the created defects before closure. Radiologic defect area measurement results at 0, 4, and 16 weeks were compared between the groups. In addition, densities of the newly formed bones at 16th week were studied. Histologic parameters (primary and secondary bone trabecula, neovascularization, and bone marrow and connective tissue formation) were compared between 4- and 16-week groups.More rapid decrease in defect size was observed in groups 3 and 4 than in groups 1 and 2, both in the 4th and 16th weeks. Newly formed bone densities were also found to be higher in these 2 groups. New bone formation was detected to be more rapid considering histologic parameters, in groups 3 and 4 at 4th and 16th weeks.Study demonstrates that PRP and PPP might have favorable effects on bone healing. Although we cannot reveal any statistical difference between these 2 substances considering osteoinductive potential, PRP group has demonstrated superior results compared with fibrin glue group. Higher platelet concentrations may expose beneficial effects of PRP.

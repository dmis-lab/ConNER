Measurement of serum glycosylated proteins and glycosylated low density lipoprotein fraction in diabetes mellitus.
A simple method was developed for estimating serum glycosylated protein levels using gel filtration with Bio-Gel P6 by determining the protein and sugar content in the void volume fraction. The glycosylated protein levels (GSP) correlated well with fasting blood sugar levels and glycosylated albumin level (G-ALB) determined by affinity chromatography with Blue Sepharose CL6B. The glycosylation level of heparin-citrate precipitable fraction of serum which predominantly contained low density lipoprotein (G-LDL) also correlated well with GSP and LDL-cholesterol levels. Significantly different values were obtained for GSP, G-ALB, and G-LDL between normals and diabetics.

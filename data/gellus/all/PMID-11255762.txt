[Study of fungus polysaccharides compounds (FPC) in inducing the apoptosis of liver cancer cell Bel-7402]. 
To observe the influence of fungus polysaccharides compounds (FPC) in inducing human liver cancer cell Bel-7402 apoptosis in cell cultivating in vitro, the authors analyzed tumor inhibitive gene P53 expression in Bel-7402 apoptosis by applying double immuno-marker. The result showed that the multilevel of FPC could all apparently induce Bel-7402 apoptosis. With the enhancement of FPC concentration, the authors observed chromatin condensation in some phases companying with the characteristic apoptosis. In the meantime, it could also greatly reduce the G1 and S, with obviously dose-response relationship. The percentage of cell apoptosis increased with the enhancing of concentration. In the high-level group the authors found typical DNA ladder eletrophoresis stripe. The result showed that the mechanism of the FPC antineoplastic effect had an intimate relation with its induction to apoptosis and that the result of FPC inducing tumor cell apoptosis had the character of P53 independence.

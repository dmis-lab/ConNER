Behavior
Across all participants, 50% +/- 13 of studied high-complexity scene were later recognized as "old" (hit rate), and 52% +/- 18 of studied low-complexity scenes were later recognized as "old". For new scenes presented at test (foils), 22% +/- 16 of high- complexity scenes were falsely categorized as "old" (false alarm rate), and 22% +/- 14 of low-complexity scenes were falsely categorized as "old". Across all participants, adjusted hit rate (hit rate - false alarm rate) for high-complexity scenes (28% +/- 13) did not differ from that for low-complexity scenes (30% +/- 14) (t(45) = 1.02, p = 0.31). Critically, the adjusted hit rate increased with age for high-complexity (r = 0.40, p = 0.006), but not for low-complexity (r = 0.11, p = 0.46) scenes. Thus, overall participants had similar memory accuracy for high- and low-complexity scenes, but memory accuracy improved with age only for high-complexity scenes.
Participants categorized as "remembered" (RHIT), 28% +/- 12 of the studied high- complexity scenes, and 29% +/- 15 of the studied low-complexity scenes. Participants had similar rates of falsely categorizing as "remembered" (RFA) high (5% +/- 6) and low (5% +/- 6) complexity foils. Across all participants, adjusted R rates (RHIT-RFA) for high-complexity scenes did not differ from that for low-complexity scenes (t(45) = 1.41, p = 0.17). Adjusted R rates increased with age for high-complexity (r = 0.38, p = 0.009), but not for low-complexity (r = 0.16, p = 0.30), scenes (Figures 1C,D). The difference between the adjusted R rates of high- and low- complexity scenes increased with age (r = 0.27, p = 0.03; 1-tailed), suggesting that the age-related improvements in memory performance were more robust for recollected high-complexity scenes. Thus, overall, participants had similar memory accuracy for recollected high- and low-complexity scenes, but accuracy for recollected high-complexity scenes improved with age, whereas accuracy for recollected low-complexity scenes did not change with age.
Participants categorized as "familiar" (KHIT), 22% +/- 9 of studied high-complexity scenes, and 22% +/- 10 of studied low-complexity scenes. Participants falsely categorized as "familiar" (KFA) 17% +/- 11 of high-complexity, and 17% +/- 12 of low-complexity foils. Across all participants, adjusted K rates (KHIT-KFA) for high- complexity scenes did not differ from that for low-complexity scenes (t(45) = 0.06, p = 0.95). Adjusted K rates did not change with age for either high-complexity or low-complexity scenes (|r|s < 0.09, ps > 0.56) (Figures 1C,D).
During the encoding task, participants were overall faster to respond to low-complexity scenes (1072 +/- 275 ms) than to high-complexity scenes (1093 +/- 287 ms) (t(45) = 2.31, p = 0.03). Response times decreased with age for low- (r = -0.37, p = 0.01) and high- (r = -0.33, p = 0.03) complexity scenes. The difference between the response times for high- and low-complexity scenes, however, did not change with age (r = 0.14, p = 0.35). Response times decreased with age for R, K and F trial types for both high- and low-complexity scenes (-0.36 < r < -0.30, ps < 0.04). The difference between response times for R and F trial types, however, did not change with age for either high (r = 0.12, p = 0.43) or low complexity scenes (r = 0.08, p = 0.60).

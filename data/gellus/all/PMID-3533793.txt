Suppression and re-expression of transformed phenotype in hybrids of HA-ras-1-transformed rat-1 cells and early-passage rat embryonic fibroblasts. 
Rat-1 cells which had been transformed with the activated Ha-ras-1 gene from human EJ bladder carcinoma cells were fused with diploid embryonic rat fibroblasts. Four selected cell hybrids expressed the human transforming gene product p21 at levels of 10 to 30% compared to 100% in the transformed parental cells. The hybrid cells, however, exhibited normal morphology, anchorage requirement for proliferation, and largely extended latency periods of tumorigenicity in newborn rats. Tumorigenic hybrid derivatives contained lower numbers of chromosomes than the tetraploid parental hybrids. DNA of the non-tumorigenic cell hybrids transformed Rat-1 cells to anchorage-independent proliferation as expected for the transforming human Ha-ras gene present in the donor DNA. We conclude that the transforming properties of the activated Ha-ras gene in Rat-1 cells can be suppressed at the post-translational level by the presence of the genome from diploid embryonic rat fibroblasts but additional controls of expression of the transforming gene are likely to exist. Normal cells contain suppressor gene(s) which safeguard these cells against transformation by the product of the transforming Ha-ras-1 oncogene.

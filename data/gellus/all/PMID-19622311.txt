[The prediction of the level of depression by cognitive, behavioral, and temperamental variables in a six-month time interval].
Several models have been proposed to explain the depressive phenomenon, such as the theory of dysfunctional attitudes, the hopelessness theory, the behavioral model of activity level, or temperamental models. This article presents data about the role of those models in the prediction of the level of depression in a sample of 414 college students, assessed over a temporal interval of six months. Dysfunctional attitudes, attributional styles, the level of activity, and the five-factors of personality were assessed. The BDI-II was the depression level measure. The results showed that these variables predict depression levels, but with low coefficients. The dimensions of Need of Achievement (a dysfunctional attitude) and Neuroticism had particularly greater weight in the prediction, but only Neuroticism seems to behave like a vulnerability element. Attributional styles did not contribute significantly to the prediction of depression. Activity level lost its predictive role during the 6-month interval. These results are discussed according to the role of the proposed models and the need for a deeper explanation of the variance of depression scores.

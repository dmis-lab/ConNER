Antibodies to PAI-1 alter the invasive and migratory properties of human tumour cells in vitro. 
Recent reports suggest that elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may contribute to tumour progression. The studies reported here were designed to help elucidate PAI-1's contribution to the invasive and migratory phenotype. Antibodies to PA-1 dose-dependently, and significantly, inhibited the invasive and migratory potential of human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, as did an antibody to uPA and the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin. Invasion of the human melanoma cell line, BLM, was also attenuated by the anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibody MAI-12. The non-invasive human melanoma cell line, IF6, which does not express uPA, provided further confirmation of PAI-1 and uPA's role as, upon transfection with uPA, this cell line attained an invasive phenotype, which was again attenuated by MAI-12. Although antibodies to PAI-1 did not affect the adhesion of HT1080 cells to vitronectin, the antibody to uPA reduced their attachment. Addition of exogenous PAI-1, however, prevented HT1080 cell adhesion (IC50 180 nM) and promoted cell detachment from vitronectin. Furthermore melanoma cells transfected with a uPA variant, which had an impaired interaction with PAI-1, were not invasive and had impaired binding to vitronectin. These data highlight the importance of a balanced proteolysis and suggest an additional role for PAI-1 distinct from its role in proteolysis. These data also suggest that uPA and PAI-1 may co-operate in the migratory process by respectively facilitating the attachment to, and subsequent detachment from, vitronectin in the extracellular matrix. These results support the clinical findings and indicate that modulation of PAI-1 activity may be of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of cancer.

Management of the tortuous internal carotid artery.
The tortuous internal carotid artery as the basis of cerebral vascular insufficiency is a controversial entity, as such lesions frequently occur without neurologic symptoms. However, some tortuous vessels are associated with significant carotid atherosclerotic disease requiring a specific surgical approach. This formed the basis of our report. Symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency in association with a tortuous internal carotid artery was encountered in 27 of 853 carotid endarterectomies over a 22 year period. Stenosis of hemodynamic significance was noted in nine patients and irregularities or ulceration were noted in the rest. With the standard technique of carotid endarterectomy, removal of plaque from a tortuous vessel leads to loss of the stenting effect provided by the plaque such that angulation occlusion is likely to occur. The optimal reconstruction in our experience is eversion endarterectomy by transection and lower reimplantation of the internal carotid artery on the common carotid artery. Our experience with 17 such procedures in 15 patients has been presented.

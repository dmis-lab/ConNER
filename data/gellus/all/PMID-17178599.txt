Role of the fibrinolytic and matrix metalloproteinase systems in development of adipose tissue.
Obesity is a common disorder and related diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Western-type societies. Development of obesity is associated with extensive modifications in adipose tissue involving adipogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix proteolysis. The fibrinolytic (plasminogen/plasmin) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems cooperate in these processes. A nutritionally induced obesity model in transgenic mice has been used extensively to study the role of the fibrinolytic and MMP systems in the development of obesity. These studies support a role of both systems in adipogenesis and obesity; the role of specific members of these families, however, remains to be determined.

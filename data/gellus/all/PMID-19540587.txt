The modulation of platelet and endothelial cell adhesion to vascular graft materials by perlecan.
Controlled neo-endothelialisation is critical to the patency of small diameter vascular grafts. Endothelialisation and platelet adhesion to purified endothelial cell-derived perlecan, the major heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan in basement membranes, were investigated using in vivo and in vitro assays. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts were coated with perlecan and tested in an ovine carotid interposition model for a period of 6 weeks and assessed using light and scanning microscopy. Enhanced endothelial cell growth and reduced platelet adhesion were observed on the perlecan coated grafts when compared to uncoated controls implanted in the same sheep (n=5). Perlecan was also found to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation in vitro over a period of 6 days in the presence of plasma proteins and fibroblastic growth factor 2 (FGF-2), however in the absence of FGF-2 endothelial cell growth could not be maintained during this period. Perlecan was found to be anti-adhesive for platelets, however after removal of the HS chains attached to perlecan, platelet adhesion and aggregation were supported. These results suggest a role for HS chains of perlecan in improving graft patency by selectively promoting endothelial cell proliferation while modulating platelet adhesion.

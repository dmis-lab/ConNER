SUMMARY
This is a prospective study carried out to determine the outcome of patients who refuse cystectomy after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Sixty-three patients were evaluated between 1995 and 2001 who declined to undergo a planned cystectomy because they achieved a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Herr assessed patient, tumor and treatment features for a median follow- up of 86 months, all patients being followed-up for more than 5 years. Forty patients (64%) survived, with 54% of them having an intact functioning bladder. The number and size of invasive tumors were strongly associated with the overall survival. The most significant treatment variable predicting better survival was complete resection of the invasive tumor on restaging transurethral resection (TUR) before starting chemotherapy. Of 23 patients (36%) who subsequently died of disease, 19 (30%) relapsed with invasive cancer in the bladder. Over 90% of the surviving patients had solitary, small and low-stage invasive tumors completely resected and 83% survived without relapses in the bladder.[1]

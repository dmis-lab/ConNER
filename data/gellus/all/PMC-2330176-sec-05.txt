Results and discussion
AbsC was overexpressed and purified with a final yield of approximately 10 mg of protein from 1 l culture and was judged to be greater than 98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. The DLS analysis after gel filtration showed a monomodal distribution, with a polydispersity value of 18.9% and a molecular-size estimate of 39.6 kDa. This was comparable to the value of 36 kDa estimated from the calibrated gel-filtration column, strongly suggesting that AbsC exists as a homodimer in solution (calculated molecular weight of 41.0 kDa for the His-tagged dimer), in agreement with other characterized MarR homologues.
Preliminary crystals grew within 24 h at 293 K from several different crystallization conditions. Improved crystals were subsequently obtained with a precipitant solution consisting of 1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.55 M potassium sodium tartrate in 100 mM citrate pH 5.6, giving crystals with approximate dimensions of 700 x 50 x 50 microm (Fig. 1 >).
Native X-ray data were collected from a single AbsC crystal: a total of 214 x 0.4degrees oscillation images were recorded in a continuous sweep to a maximum resolution of 2.25 A. Indexing was consistent with a primitive orthorhombic lattice, with unit-cell parameters a = 43.53, b = 121.30, c = 143.75 A. After processing the data in space group P222, pseudo-precession plots were analysed using HKLVIEW (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994 >) and the systematic absences were indicative of space group P212121. Reprocessing in this space group yielded a data set that was 95.6% complete to 2.25 A resolution. Data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 1 >.
Estimation of the content of the asymmetric unit (ASU) suggested that three or four His-tagged AbsC subunits were most likely, giving solvent contents of 60.3% or 47.0% and crystal-packing parameters (V M) of 3.09 or 2.32 A3 Da-1, respectively. Given that both DLS and gel filtration suggest that AbsC is dimeric and that MarR homologues exist as homodimers (Wilkinson & Grove, 2006 >), an even number of subunits per ASU, i.e. four, would seem to be the most probable (Matthews, 1968 >).
A Patterson function calculated on data in the resolution range 10.0-3.0 A revealed a significant peak (at 24% of the origin peak) with a vector of u = 0.0, v = 0.5, w = 0.014, indicating that one or more molecules in the ASU were similarly orientated. A self-rotation function calculated on data in the resolution range 10.0-5.0 A using MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2000 >) did not show any clear noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS), perhaps suggesting that if NCS axes were present they were parallel (or almost parallel) to crystallographic axes.
Fold prediction, based on the amino-acid sequence of AbsC, was performed using the FUGUE server (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~fugue/prfsearch.html; Shi et al., 2001 >). This found eight 'certain' hits, with the top three being MarR (PDB code 1jgs; Z score 21.4; 18% sequence identity), SlyA (PDB code 1lj9; Z score 18.4; 16% sequence identity) and YusO (PDB code 1s3j; Z score 15.7; 16% sequence identity). All three hits were used as search models for molecular replacement in the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994 >), but none yielded plausible solutions against the 2.25 A resolution native data set, although this is not too surprising given their very low sequence identities. Thus, we will need to solve the AbsC structure by isomorphous replacement methods. To this end, we are preparing selenomethionine-labelled protein; there are a total of seven methionine residues present in the 158-amino-acid sequence of AbsC.

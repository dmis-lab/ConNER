Stimulation of the sodium pump by azide and high internal sodium: changes in the number of pumping sites and turnover rate.
1. The effects of 5 mM azide on [3H]ouabain uptake and 22Na efflux were determined. Both glycoside uptake and 22Na efflux were enhanced by azide. 2. Azide stimulated the Na pump in muscles whose pumping sites had been inhibited by ouabain and then transferred to a glycoside-free solution. This stimulation was observed before detecting any recovery of the initial pumping activity. 3. When both the resting and the azide-stimulated 22Na efflux had been blocked by ouabain, an additional exposure to azide, in a ouabain-free solution, had no further effects on 22Na efflux. 4. It is concluded that the increase in Na pumping caused by azide is due in part to an increase in the number of pumping sites. 5. [3H]ouabain binding was measured in muscles with different intracellular alkali cation concentrations. Variations in [Na]i from 15 up to 50 mM did not significantly affect the amount of glycoside bound. A substantial increase in binding occurred when [Na]i reached 70 mM. 6. It is proposed that the increase in Na extrusion that occurs during the recovery of Na loaded muscles mostly results from an increased turnover rate of the pump rather than from an increase in number of pumping sites.

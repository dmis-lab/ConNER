Characterization of transferrin glycoforms in human serum by CE-UV and CE-ESI-MS.
Human transferrin (Tf) is a model glycoprotein for congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) diagnosis. In the last few years, new CE-UV methods for intact Tf glycoforms analysis have been developed using nonvolatile BGEs and organic modifiers. However, the use of these BGEs does not allow the coupling of these procedures with electrospray MS (ESI-MS). In this study, a new CE-UV separation method of Tf glycoforms is developed, using a double-layer stable coating and a volatile BGE based on ammonium acetate. The separation method is optimized using standard Tf and their potential is demonstrated applying the method to the analysis of sera Tf from healthy individuals and CDG patients. The CE-UV separation method has been coupled to ESI-MS detection. Main parameters such as sheath liquid composition are optimized in order to obtain a good sensitivity. The CE-ESI-MS method has also been used in serum samples obtaining the separation of the different proteins present in serum and partial separation of Tf glycoforms. Different mass spectra and deconvoluted molecular masses were obtained for each sialoform, allowing unequivocal glycoform identification.

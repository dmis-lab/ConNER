Effects of morphological patterning on endothelial cell migration.
The migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) plays an important role in vascular remodeling. Here we studied the effects of cell morphology on the migration of bovine aortic ECs by culturing cells on micropatterned strips of collagen matrix (60-, 30-, and 15-microm wide). The spreading areas of the cells on 15- and 30-microm wide strips were 30% lower than those on 60-microm wide strips and unpatterned collagen. The cells on 15-microm wide strips completely aligned in the direction of the strip, and had significantly lower shape index than those in all other groups. On strips of all widths, ECs tended to migrate in the direction of strips. ECs on 15-microm wide strips had highest speed, particularly in the direction of the strip. Vinculin staining showed that the leading edge of ECs on 15-microm wide strips had focal adhesions that were oriented with their lamellipodial protrusion and the direction of cell migration; this arrangement of the focal adhesions may promote EC migration. The present study provides direct evidence on the role of cell morphology in EC migration, and will help us to understand the mechanisms of EC migration during angiogenesis and wound healing.

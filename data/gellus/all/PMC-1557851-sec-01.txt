Background
Hallucinations may occur in any sensory modalities. Formed musical hallucinations (i.e. Perception of either vocal or instrumental melodies) reported in English literature to date have typically been associated with marked hearing loss, advanced age, female sex (71%), lack of response to treatment and associated psychopathology [1] but has been concluded that hearing loss is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the occurrence of musical hallucinations [1]. Tumor like Astrocytoma, Temporal lobe epilepsy, raised intra cranial tension, drug induced (tricyclics, Propronolol etc ;), meningitis and psychotic illness were shown to cause palinacousis and musical hallucinations [2,3].
Musical hallucinations are pseudo hallucinations that originate in memory representations and they may undergo a transition to true hallucination. In musical hallucination spatial projection is less definite. Sometimes they are perceived like the tinnitus in patient's own head. The quality is usually very intense and distinct often very loud. They vary from elementary sounds to instrumental music, vocal music, bird songs, bells, pieces of melodies or sentences, religious music etc:- We report an unusual presentation of an elderly lady who had experienced musical hallucinations whilst being treated with Electro Convulsive Therapy. Though this has never been reported earlier, there seemed to have a good association between the initiation of Electro convulsive therapy and musical hallucination in our patient.

Transformation-associated cytokine 9E3/CEF4 is chemotactic for chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
9E3/CEF4, which is released from transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), is a member of the platelet factor 4 family of inflammatory proteins and may be the avian homolog of interleukin-8. Since the function of 9E3/CEF4 is unknown, we examined the effect of the protein on mitogenicity and chemotaxis, as well as its expression, in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells. 9E3/CEF4 mRNA was expressed in chicken peripheral blood monocytes, and its expression was stimulated by incubation of the monocytes with lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristic acetate. Boyden double-membrane analysis of chemotaxis showed that 9E3/CEF4 was chemotactic for chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as for heterophils. Untransformed CEF and CEF transformed with Rous sarcoma virus also migrated to 9E3/CEF4 protein, as measured by Boyden single-membrane analysis. 9E3/CEF4 was slightly mitogenic for CEF, causing a doubling of [3H]thymidine uptake when added to serum-starved CEF.9E3/CEF4 was found associated not only with the cell and in the culture medium of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF but also with the extracellular matrix. The in vivo role of 9E3/CEF4 may be involved with chemotaxis and metastasis, rather than with direct stimulation of mitogenicity.

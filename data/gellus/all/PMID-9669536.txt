Antisocial patients: a comparison of those with and those without childhood conduct disorder.
The purpose of this study was to compare persons with antisocial personality disorder (ASP) with those who meet the adult criteria for ASP but fail to meet the criteria for childhood conduct disorder. Sociodemographic data, medical history, and psychiatric symptoms exhibited during a recent hospital admission were compared in the two groups by chart review. The two groups were virtually indistinguishable, except that patients without childhood conduct disorder were less likely to smoke or consume alcohol, were less likely to have spent time in a training school/boot camp as a child or adolescent, were less likely to have been admitted for a recent suicide attempt, and were less likely to have conned others. We conclude that persons meeting the adult criteria for ASP but not the childhood conduct disorder criteria essentially suffer the same disorder as those who meet full ASP criteria but are less severely affected.

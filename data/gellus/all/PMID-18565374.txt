Contemporary perspectives on vital pulp therapy: views from the endodontists and pediatric dentists.
The purpose of this study was to determine the level of agreement between pediatric dentists and endodontists at a pulp therapy symposium conjointly sponsored by the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) on November 2-3, 2007. Presymposium and postsymposium tests were administered, and respondent answers were compared between pediatric dentists and endodontists. Opinions on 3 areas were sought: pulp therapy for cariously involved primary teeth; indirect pulp treatment (IPT) for cariously involved immature permanent teeth; and innovative treatment options including pulpal revascularization and regeneration. Results were analyzed with chi2 tests. Comparisons of presymposium and postsymposium responses and between the 2 groups of attendees indicated that the pediatric dentistry and endodontic communities agree that formocresol will be replaced as a primary tooth pulpotomy agent, that mineral trioxide is the first choice to take its place, that IPT in primary teeth holds hope as a replacement for pulpotomy, and that IPT is an acceptable pulp therapy technique for cariously involved young permanent teeth. Both groups believe that pulp revascularization and regeneration will be viable treatment modalities in the future. The AAE and the AAPD are positioned to begin preparation of best practice guidelines that share common language and treatment recommendations for pulp therapies performed by both specialties.

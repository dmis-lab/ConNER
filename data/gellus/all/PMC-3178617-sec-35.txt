Breeding of p53 mice with BCCIP conditional knockdown mice
The heterozygous p53 knockout mice [36] were crossed with LoxPshBCCIP+/+-4 mouse and EIIaCre+/+ mouse respectively to generate p53+/-;LoxPshBCCIP+/-, and p53+/-;EIIaCre+/- mice. The PCR primers used to genotype p53 are: p53ex6F: 5'-GTATCCCGAGTATCTGGAAGACAG-3', p53neoF: 5'-GCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACG-3', p53ex7RN: 5'-AAGGATAGGTCGGCGGTTCATGC-3'. The same PCR primer pairs as described earlier in this report were used for BCCIPshRNA and EIIaCre genotyping. The p53+/-;LoxPshBCCIP+/+ mice were obtained by crossing p53+/-;LoxPshBCCIP+/- females with p53+/-;LoxPshBCCIP+/- males. The p53+/-;LoxPshBCCIP+/+ or p53+/-;LoxPshBCCIP+/- mice were crossed with p53+/-;EIIaCre+/- mice respectively.

Efficient inhibition of ovarian cancer growth and prolonged survival by transfection with a novel pro-apoptotic gene, hPNAS-4, in a mouse model. In vivo and in vitro results.
OBJECTIVE: We transfected ovarian cancer cells and administered recombinant plasmid encoding hPNAS-4 to nude mice bearing ovarian cancer, aiming to evaluate the effect of hPNAS-4 against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells were transfected with hPNAS-4-plasmid, and cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay; apoptosis was examined by DNA ladder, Hoechst33258 staining and flow-cytometric assays. Nude mice bearing ovarian cancers were treated with hPNAS-4-p/liposome. Tumor growth was determined and survival was recorded. TUNEL assay and microvessel density was assessed to evaluate apoptosis and angiogenesis. RESULTS: Both inhibition of proliferation (p < 0.05) and induction of apoptosis (p < 0.05) were observed in SKOV3 cells transfected with hPNAS-4-p in vitro. In hPNAS-4-p-treated tumor cells in vivo, tumor growth significantly decreased, while the survival time of tumor-bearing mice was prolonged compared with control groups (p < 0.05). Increased apoptosis of tumor cells and decreased angiogenesis in tumor tissue were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our promising results on the potential antitumor effects of hPNAS-4 on ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo may be explained, in part, by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Consequently, hPNAS-4 has potential as a new gene therapy for human ovarian cancer.

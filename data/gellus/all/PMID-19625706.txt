Nicked {beta}2-glycoprotein I binds angiostatin 4.5 (plasminogen kringle 1-5) and attenuates its antiangiogenic property.
Angiostatin was first discovered as a plasminogen fragment with antitumor/antiangiogenic property. One of the angiostatin isoforms, that is, angiostatin 4.5 (AS4.5), consisting of plasminogen kringle 1 to 4 and a most part of kringle 5, is produced by autoproteolysis and present in human plasma. beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) is proteolytically cleaved by plasmin in its domain V (nicked beta2GPI), resulting in binding to plasminogen. Antiangiogenic properties have been recently reported in nicked beta2GPI as well as in intact beta2GPI at higher concentrations. In the present study, we found significant binding of nicked beta2GPI to AS4.5 (K(D) = 3.27 x 10(6) M(-1)). Via this binding, nicked beta2GPI attenuates the antiangiogenic functions of AS4.5 in the proliferation of arterial/venous endothelial cells, in the extracellular matrix invasion and the tube formation of venous endothelial cells, and in vivo angiogenesis. In contrast, intact beta2GPI does not bind to AS4.5 or inhibit its antiangiogenic activity. Thus, nicked beta2GPI exerts dual effects on angiogenesis, that is, nicked beta2GPI promotes angiogenesis in the presence of AS4.5, whereas nicked beta2GPI inhibits angiogenesis at concentrations high enough to neutralize AS4.5. Our data suggest that plasmin-nicked beta2GPI promotes angiogenesis by interacting with plasmin-generated AS4.5 in sites of increased fibrinolysis such as thrombus.

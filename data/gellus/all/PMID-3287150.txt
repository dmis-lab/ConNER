Multi-step neoplastic transformation of normal human fibroblasts by Co-60 gamma rays and Ha-ras oncogenes. 
As reported previously (Namba et al., 1985; Namba, 1985), normal human fibroblasts were transformed into immortal cells with abnormal karyotypes by Co-60 gamma-ray irradiation. These immortally transformed cells (KMST-6) showed no clonability in soft agar and were not tumorigenic. However, by treatment with Ha-ras oncogenes derived from a human lung carcinoma or Harvey murine sarcoma virus, the KMST-6 cells acquired elevated clonability in soft agar and transplantability in nude mice. All the tumors produced grew progressively without showing regression and killed the mice. The tumors were also serially transplantable into other mice. The Ha-ras oncogene alone did not convert normal human fibroblasts into either immortal or tumorigenic cells. Our current data suggest that gamma rays worked as an initiator of carcinogenesis in normal human cells, giving rise to chromosome aberrations and immortality, and the Ha-ras oncogene played a role in the progression of the immortally transformed cell population to a neoplastic one showing enhanced colony formation in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice.

Host-derived angiopoietin-2 affects early stages of tumor development and vessel maturation but is dispensable for later stages of tumor growth.
The angiopoietin/Tie2 system has been identified as the second vascular-specific receptor tyrosine kinase system controlling vessel assembly, maturation, and quiescence. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is prominently up-regulated in the host-derived vasculature of most tumors, making it an attractive candidate for antiangiogenic intervention. Yet, the net outcome of Ang-2 functions on tumor angiogenesis is believed to be contextual depending on the local cytokine milieu. Correspondingly, Ang-2 manipulatory therapies have been shown to exert protumorigenic as well as antitumorigenic effects. To clarify the role of Ang-2 for angiogenesis and tumor growth in a definite genetic experimental setting, the present study was aimed at comparatively studying the growth of different tumors in wild-type and Ang-2-deficient mice. Lewis lung carcinomas, MT-ret melanomas, and B16F10 melanomas all grew slower in Ang-2-deficient mice. Yet, tumor growth in wild-type and Ang-2-deficient mice dissociated during early stages of tumor development, whereas tumor growth rates during later stages of primary tumor progression were similar. Analysis of the intratumoral vascular architecture revealed no major differences in microvessel density and perfusion characteristics. However, diameters of intratumoral microvessels were smaller in tumors grown in Ang-2-deficient mice, and the vasculature had an altered pattern of pericyte recruitment and maturation. Ang-2-deficient tumor vessels had higher pericyte coverage indices. Recruited pericytes were desmin and NG2 positive and predominately alpha-smooth muscle actin negative, indicative of a more mature pericyte phenotype. Collectively, the experiments define the role of Ang-2 during tumor angiogenesis and establish a better rationale for combination therapies involving Ang-2 manipulatory therapies.

A potential role for the Src-like adapter protein SLAP-2 in signaling by the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor.
The development of macrophages from myeloid progenitor cells is primarily controlled by the growth factor colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and its cognate receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-Fms proto-oncogene. The CSF-1 receptor exerts its biological effects on cells via a range of signaling proteins including Erk1/2 and Akt. Here we have investigated the potential involvement of the Src-like adapter protein (SLAP-2) in signaling by the CSF-1 receptor in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. RT-PCR analysis revealed constitutive expression of the SLAP-2 gene in bone marrow macrophages. Surprisingly, co-immunoprecipitation and GST binding experiments demonstrated that the CSF-1 receptor could bind to SLAP-2 in a ligand-independent manner. Furthermore, the binding of SLAP-2 to the CSF-1 receptor involved multiple domains of SLAP-2. SLAP-2 also bound c-Cbl, with the interaction being mediated, at least in part, by the unique C-terminal domain of SLAP-2. Overexpression of SLAP-2 in bone marrow macrophages partially suppressed the CSF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and/or expression level of a approximately 80 kDa protein without affecting CSF-1-induced global tyrosine phosphorylation, or activation of Akt or Erk1/2. Significantly, CSF-1 stimulation induced serine phosphorylation of SLAP-2. Pharmacologic inhibition of specific protein kinases revealed that CSF-1-induced phosphorylation of SLAP-2 was dependent on JNK activity. Taken together, our results suggest that SLAP-2 could potentially be involved in signaling by the CSF-1 receptor.

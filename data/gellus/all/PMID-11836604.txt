Prognostic significance of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. 
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been defined as proteins induced by heat shock and other environmental and pathophysiologic stress. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is one of the small heat shock proteins. HSP27 is implicated in protein-protein interactions such as folding, translocation, and prevention of inappropriate protein aggregation. Many of their functions suggest that they play important roles in cancers. Archival tissues from 40 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who received primary surgical resection were examined for HSP27 by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, histological grade and survival period. HSP27 expression was positive staining (+) in 20 (50%), weak or negative staining (-) in 20 (50%) of total 40 cases. There was no correlation between HSP27 expression and clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and histological grade. However, when compared with clinicopathological features, the expression of HSP27 correlated inversely with survival period. This study suggests that the expression of HSP27 is frequently promoted in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and should be considered an independent prognostic factor of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.

(a) Sequence alignment of PY-NLSs. The homologous regions of C-NLS of the EWS protein, NLS of Sam68 and FUS/TLS protein and M9 NLS of hnRNP A1 and hnRNP M, classified as PY-NLS are in yellow boxes. Phosphorylated Y656 of the EWS protein and Y440 of Sam68 are indicated (in red). Positions of identical residues in SAM68 and EWS C-NLS are indicated in bold and residues with identical charges are underlined. Known positions of the FUS/TLS mutations in ALS are in bold. (b) Subcellular localization of YFP, the C-terminally tagged EWS-YFP, EWS(Y656A)-YFP, EWS(Y656F)-YFP, and EWS(Y656D)-YFP (in green). Nuclei are shown by DAPI staining (in blue). Bars, 15 mum.

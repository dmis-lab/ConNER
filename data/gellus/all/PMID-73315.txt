An unusual case of benign mucous membrane pemphigoid.
This case of benign mucous membrane pemphigoid (BMMP) is unusual in that blistering, scarring lesions were confined to the skin for 15 years before mucous membranes were involved. The onset of this disorder at the age of 38 is also unusual. Detailed immunological investigation was performed on this patient but the results in no way clarify the present confusion regarding the immunopathological processes in BMMP related to those operative in bullous pemphigoid.

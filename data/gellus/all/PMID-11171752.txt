Focal congenital alveolar proteinosis associated with abnormal surfactant protein B messenger RNA.
Two siblings presented with typical clinical features of congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Necropsy of one sibling revealed scattered foci of the diagnostic histologic changes in the lung tissue. In contrast to infantile and adult PAP, focal distribution is uncommon in congenital PAP. Defective expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor was ruled out. The surfactant protein B (SP-B) content in the lung tissue of the autopsied patient was low, and a deletion in the SP-B messenger RNA was detected. We speculate that the PAP in our patients was related to the reduced quantity and/or to the altered quality of SP-B.

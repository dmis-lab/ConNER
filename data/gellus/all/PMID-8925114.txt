Functional model of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using an isolated frog semicircular canal.
Bull frogs posterior semicircular canals (psc) wee used to simulate the condition of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The psc was isolated in frog Ringer's solution, and the saccular otoconia were used as a responsible material to stimulate the cupula. When the otoconia were placed on the cupular surface to mimic the condition of cupulolithiasis, the psc ampullary nerve action potentials instantaneously changed according to the direction of the gravity produced by otoconia. When the otoconia were dropped into the canal to mimic the condition of moving otoconia in the canal, the action potentials changed together with the otoconial flow after a latent period. Both cupulolithiasis and moving otoconia are possibly valid mechanisms of BPPV, since they effectively stimulate the cupula. However, moving otoconia with a latent period would better explain clinical features of BPPV.

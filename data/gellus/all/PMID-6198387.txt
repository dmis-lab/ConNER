Role of interleukin 1 in antigen-specific T cell proliferation.
The role of interleukin 1 (IL 1) in human antigen-specific T cell proliferation was examined. Nylon wool-purified T cells proliferated in the presence of autologous monocytes (Mo.) pulsed for 18 h with tetanus toxoid (TT) antigen (Mo.TT). Irradiation of Mo.TT with ultraviolet (UV) light (72 J/m2) abolished their capacity to support T cell proliferation and drastically reduced their capacity to secrete IL 1 after stimulation with Staphylococcus albus. The defect in antigen presentation induced by UV irradiation of Mo.TT was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of two different preparations containing human interleukin 1 (IL 1). The first preparation consisted of supernatants of Mo. stimulated with Con A for 18 hr and in which Con A activity was blocked by alpha-D-methyl-mannoside (Mo.-Con A-Sup). The second preparation consisted of human IL 1 partially purified from supernatants of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with S. albus. This IL 1 copurified with human leukocyte pyrogen (LP) and was termed IL 1/LP. Both IL 1-containing preparations enhanced the response of C57BL/6 mouse thymocytes to phytohemagglutinin. A rabbit antibody to human IL 1/LP inhibited the capacity of T cells to proliferate in response to Mo.TT and inhibited the capacity of Mo.-Con A-Sup to reconstitute the T cell response to UV-irradiated Mo.TT. IL 1/LP was not necessary for T cells to recognize the immunogenic moiety presented by Mo., because monolayers of UV-irradiated Mo.TT were equivalent to monolayers of unirradiated MO.TT in their capacity to adsorb TT-reactive T cells specifically. Furthermore, the addition of rabbit antibody to IL 1/LP did not interfere with the capacity of UV-irradiated Mo.TT to adsorb TT-reactive T cells. The results obtained in this study indicate that IL 1 is involved in optimal antigen-driven proliferation of human T lymphocytes.

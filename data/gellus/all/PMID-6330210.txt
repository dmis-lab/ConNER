Oesophageal candidiasis and croup in a child with defective neutrophil motility.
Severe oesophageal candidiasis and croup due to involvement of the larynx developed insidiously in a girl aged 20 months. There had been delayed separation of the umbilical cord and repeated infections associated with a defect of neutrophil motility. The significance of the early clinical features was not fully appreciated and the diagnosis considered only when stricture of the oesophagus became evident. She was treated with oral ketoconazole 100 mg daily. After one month's treatment there was striking radiological improvement apart from the persistence of the oesophageal stricture. The croup resolved completely but there was only partial relief of dysphagia because of the residual stricture. We would emphasis that candidiasis should be anticipated and treated vigorously in children with such a defect of neutrophil motility.

Management of early and advanced colorectal cancer: therapeutic issues.
PURPOSE: The staging of colorectal cancer, therapeutic decision making in the management of early and advanced colorectal cancer, and dilemmas posed by drug-related toxicity are discussed. SUMMARY: Staging of colorectal cancer occurs after surgery and is based on the extent of disease invasiveness and dissemination. Surgery is the primary treatment for stage I disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended after resection in selected high-risk patients with stage II disease and in all patients with stage III disease. Convenience of administration, tolerability, and patient factors not necessarily age may be considerations in decisions about adjuvant therapy after resection. Treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer is based on the type of prior therapy and patient-specific factors. Recently, significant improvements in survival have been achieved through the use of combination chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody regimens. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is first-line therapy for stage IV disease. Age alone should not preclude the use of chemotherapy in stage IV colorectal cancer, although the ability to tolerate drug-related toxicity may be a consideration. The optimal duration of chemotherapy in patients with early and metastatic colorectal cancer is unclear. CONCLUSION: The optimal approach to the treatment of colorectal cancer depends on several considerations, including patient-specific factors.

Prognostic value of p53 protein expression and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in resected squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
The most common genetic alterations found in a wide variety of cancers are p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. p53 appears to be a nuclear transcription factor that plays a role in the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the maintenance of genetic stability. Angiogenesis is a critical process in solid tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a recently identified growth factor with significant angiogenic properties, may be a major tumor angiogenesis regulator. Few studies have investigated the association between p53 and VEGF expressions and prognosis in esophageal carcinoma. Forty-seven specimens resected from patients with stage II and III squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were studied using immunohistochemical staining. VEGF and p53 expressions were observed in 40% and 53% of the tumors, respectively. The p53 and VEGF staining statuses were coincident in only 21% of the tumors, and no significant correlation was found between p53 and VEGF statuses. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly correlated with p53 or VEGF expression. No significant association between p53 and VEGF expressions and poor prognosis was found. In conclusion, p53 and VEGF were not correlated with prognosis in patients with stage II and III SCC of the esophagus.

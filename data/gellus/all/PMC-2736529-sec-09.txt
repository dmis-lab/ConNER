Assessment of various forms of bevavioural addictions
A first approach for the comprehensive and standardized assessment of different forms of behavioural addictions (e.g., pathological gambling, workaholism, compulsive buying) is the German self-assessment questionnaire "Fragebogen zur Differenzierten Anamnese exzessiver Verhaltensweisen" (FDAV, Questionnaire on Differentiated Assessment of Excessive Behaviours) [96]. The FDAV is based on the criteria of substance-related addictions, pathological gambling and impulse control disorders of the ICD-10 [3] and the DSM-IV-TR [2].
The FDAV is a modified version of the "Fragebogen zur Differenzierten Drogenanamnese" (FDDA; Questionnaire on Differentiated Assessment of Addiction, QDAA) [97]. Its seven modules obtain "sociodemographic information" (e.g., age, profession, marital status), "history of excessive behaviour" (e.g., diagnostic criteria for addictions and impulse control disorder, individual patterns of behaviour, craving symptoms), "critical life events" (stress caused by traumatic events), "legal situation", "medical history", "physical and psychological complaints", and "emotional state" (triggering psychological conditions, or consequences of the addictive behaviour, respectively). Every module can be administered separately according to the suspected behavioural addiction, thereby making the FDAV an economical tool in assessing behavioural addictions. The FDAV is suitable for diagnostics, evaluation of therapy and follow-up in clinical practice and research. Currently, the FDAV is being validated in clinical and non-clinical samples.

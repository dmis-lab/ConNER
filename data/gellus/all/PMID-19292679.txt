The effect of perfluorocarbon-based artificial oxygen carriers on tissue-engineered trachea.
The biological effect of the perfluorocarbon-based artificial oxygen carrier (Oxygent) was investigated in tissue-engineered trachea (TET) construction. Media supplemented with and without 10% Oxygent were compared in all assessments. Partial tissue oxygen tension (PtO(2)) was measured with polarographic microprobes; epithelial metabolism was monitored by microdialysis inside the TET epithelium perfused with the medium underneath. Chondrocyte-DegraPol constructs were cultured for 1 month with the medium before glycosaminoglycan assessment and histology. Tissue reaction of TET epithelial scaffolds immersed with the medium was evaluated on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. Oxygent perfusion medium increased the TET epithelial PtO(2) (51.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg vs. 33.4 +/- 0.3 mm Hg at 200 microm thickness; 12.5 +/- 0.1 mm Hg vs. 3.1 +/- 0.1 mm Hg at 400 microm thickness, p  less than  0.01) and decreased the lactate concentration (0.63 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.80 +/- 0.06 mmol/L, p  less than  0.05), lactate/pyruvate (1.87 +/- 0.26 vs. 3.36 +/- 10.13, p  less than  0.05), and lactate/glucose ratios (0.10 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.14, p  less than  0.05). Chondrocyte-DegraPol in Oxygent group presented lower glycosaminoglycan value (0.03 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.00, p  less than  0.05); histology slides showed poor acid mucopolysaccharides formation. Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging showed no difference in functional capillary density between the scaffolds cultured on chorioallantoic membranes. The foreign body reaction was similar in both groups. We conclude that Oxygent increases TET epithelial PtO(2), improves epithelial metabolism, does not impair angiogenesis, and tends to slow cartilage tissue formation.

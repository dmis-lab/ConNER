CLINICAL PROTEOMICS AT THE BEDSIDE
Clinically-based proteomics has a large potential for the development of strategies which aim to alleviate risk associated with cardiac disease. Biomarkers that are used in clinical practice are highly useful in that they support medical decision making, by complementing other diagnostic tests, such as the medical history, physical examination, and various other special tests. Theoretically, there are three criteria that, if satisfied, would provide an optimal biomarker of the disease state. First, the potential biomarkers must be easily measurable in a short time period at a cost that is practical. Second, elevation of this protein would offer diagnostic information that was not previously present in the absence of the protein. Third, the information obtained would aid in the medical decision making process performed by the clinician [11]. Fulfillment of such criteria encourages follow-up of such a biomarker in other model systems or patient cohort samples. For instance, cardiac troponin I has been previously shown to fulfill such criteria, and further follow-up in patient cohorts is underway. Recently, this approach was utilized to ascertain whether Cardiac Troponin I (CTN I) or Creatine Kinase-Myoglobin (CK-MB) could be used as short-term or long-term markers of risk associated with cardiac surgery [12]. In this study, a patient cohort of 252 individuals who had undergone cardiac surgery was used to analyze levels of these two proteins in blood. Not only was CTN-I shown to be a strong predictor of mortality, but increases in the levels of this protein also correlated well with increases in mortality. Findings from this study support the utilization of patient cohorts as a means to ease the transition from bench to bedside.

A small peptide derived from Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) functions as an angiogenic inhibitor.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic stimulator which functions through two endothelial specific tyrosine kinase receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1. In this work, we show that an 11-amino acid peptide derived from the second immunoglobulin-like domain of Flt-1 functions as an angiogenic inhibitor in chick chorioallantoic membrane and inhibited VEGF-induced vascular permeability in Miles' assay without binding to VEGF directly. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses indicate that this peptide forms a stable extended structure in solution, presumably beta-sheet structure and is most likely existing as a dimer. Our results suggest that this small peptide functions as an angiogenic inhibitor by inhibiting VEGF function through a non-VEGF binding mechanism.

Whole-Body gamma-Irradiation
To evaluate differential sensitivity to irradiation, mice were exposed to gamma-irradiation (4-10 Gy, single dose) and closely monitored throughout the experimentation period. Animals were killed at the first appearance of signs of poor health. Recipients of bone marrow transplants were pre-irradiated with a total dose of 10.2 Gy (two doses of 5.1 Gy, 3 h apart). For in vivo DNA damage experiments, mice were irradiated with a single dose of 5Gy and killed after 1, 3 or 6 hours. All irradiations were carried out in a Cesium Mark1 irradiator (Shepherd Associates).

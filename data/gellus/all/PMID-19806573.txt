[Effect of osteopontin silencing by lentivirus-mediated delivery of siRNA on glioma cell invasion and apoptosis]. 
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of osteopontin silencing on the invasion and apoptosis of U251 cells. METHODS: The invasion, apoptosis and levels of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by invasion assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR respectively. RESULTS: Osteopontin small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibited osteopontin expression and cell invasion, promoted apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2, uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was decreased, while Bax level was elevated. CONCLUSION: Osteopontin siRNA can inhibit U251 cells invasion via the down-regulation of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, and promote apoptosis through induction of Bax expression and inhibition of Bcl 2 level. It suggests that osteopontin plays an important role in human glioma progression.

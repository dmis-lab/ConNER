Transforming growth factor beta 1 promotes spontaneous transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells. 
The neoplastic transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells by various means has consistently been associated with the development of resistance to the mito-inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), suggesting that such phenotype plays a mechanistic role during the transformation of these cells. We have studied the induction of the "TGF-beta-resistant" phenotype in a clonal strain of early passage WB-F344 normal cultured rat liver epithelial cells, the proliferation of which was markedly inhibited by TGF-beta. The control WB cells in continuous culture slowly developed TGF-beta resistance. However, when the same cells were exposed to step-wise increases of TGF-beta concentration in their culture medium, the development of TGF-beta resistance was accelerated. Cells which had been grown in medium containing 1 ng/ml TGF-beta developed colony-forming capacity in soft agar containing epidermal growth factor. Cells which were grown in media containing 5 and 10 ng/ml TGF-beta demonstrated a low level of colony-forming efficiency in soft agar medium without added epidermal growth factor and tumorigenicity in isogeneic rats. These TGF-beta-resistant cells also exhibited progressively increasing levels of expression of the c-fos and and myc mRNA, and increased resistance to the cytotoxicity of Adriamycin and melphalan. The latter phenomenon was accompanied by an increase in the mdr-1 mRNA expression, cellular glutathione level, and glutathione S-transferase activity. The results suggest that chronic exposure to high concentration of TGF-beta promotes the spontaneous neoplastic transformation of cultured rat liver epithelial cells, and that this process may represent one of the mechanisms of cellular adaptation for induction of the multidrug-resistant phenotype during the carcinogenesis of epithelial cells.

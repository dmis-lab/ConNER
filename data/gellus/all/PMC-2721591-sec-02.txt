Recurrent anterior vaginal wall prolapse can develop in more than 20% of patients undergoing traditional anterior colporrhaphy. In light of this high recurrence rate many surgeons have been incorporating synthetic or allograft mesh to augment the repair.
In this study there are some shortcomings, including retrospective design, short follow-up for a study spanning almost six years and a lack of validated questionnaires. Authors report a negative experience with porcine dermis, both in terms of success and extrusion rate. However, others have reported better outcome[1] which may be due to different follow-up times and outcome measures. Apart from this, biological grafts are also associated with allergic reactions and disease transmission. There is paucity of data regarding prospective randomized trials on the use of these biomaterials prior to their widespread human need which might help in reducing such type of experiences. Unless such data are available surgeons should give serious thought prior to embarking on the use of such biological materials.[2]

Inhibition of angiogenesis by the cancer chemopreventive agent conjugated linoleic acid.
Dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown previously to inhibit rat mammary carcinogenesis. In addition to direct effects on mammary epithelial cells,including decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis, CLA may exert its effects indirectly by inhibiting the differentiation of mammary stromal cells to an endothelial cell type. Specifically, CLA was found to decrease the ability of mammary stromal cells to form complex anastomosing microcapillary networks in vitro on Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-derived reconstituted basement membrane. This suggested that CLA might inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. To test this possibility, CD2/F(1) mice were placed on synthetic diets containing 0, 1, or 2% CLA for 6 weeks, before angiogenic challenge by s.c. injection with an angiogenic gel substrate (Matrigel pellet assay). After 7 days, the pellets from animals fed the control diet were infiltrated by abundant branching networks of blood vessels with patent lumen-containing RBCs. In contrast, pellets from the CLA-fed animals contained fewer infiltrating cells, which formed limited branching cellular networks, the majority of which had collapsed lumen and no RBCs. Both levels of dietary CLA showed similar effects, with the number of RBC-containing vessels per 20x field decreased to a third of that seen in control. Dietary CLA decreased serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and whole mammary gland levels of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1. Both cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA isomers were effective in inhibiting angiogenesis in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. The ability of CLA to inhibit angiogenesis may contribute to its efficacy as a chemopreventive agent.

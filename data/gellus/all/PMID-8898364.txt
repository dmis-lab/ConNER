Induction of p18INK4c and its predominant association with CDK4 and CDK6 during myogenic differentiation.
Terminal cell differentiation involves permanent withdrawal from the cell division cycle. The inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are potential molecules functioning to couple cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation. In murine C2C12 myoblast cells, G1 CDK enzymes (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) associate with four CDK inhibitors: p18INK4c, p19INK4d, p21, and p27Kip1. During induced myogenesis, p21 and its associated CDK proteins underwent an initial increase followed by a decrease as cells became terminally differentiated. The level of p27 protein gradually increased, but the amount of total associated CDK proteins remained unchanged. p19 protein decreased gradually during differentiation, as did its associated CDK4 protein. In contrast, p18 protein increased 50-fold, from negligible levels in proliferating myoblasts to clearly detectable levels within 8-12 h of myogenic induction. This initial rise was followed by a precipitous increase between 12 and 24 h postinduction, with p18 protein finally accumulating to its highest level in terminally differentiated cells. Induction of p18 correlated with increased and sequential complex formation--first increasing association with CDK6 and then with CDK4 over the course of myogenic differentiation. All of the CDK6 and half of the CDK4 were complexed with p18 in terminally differentiated C2C12 cells as well as in adult mouse muscle tissue. Finally, kinase activity of CDK2 and CDK4 decreases as C2C12 cells differentiate, whereas the CDK6 kinase activity is low in both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Our results indicate that p18 may play a critical role in causing and/or maintaining permanent cell cycle arrest associated with mature muscle formation.

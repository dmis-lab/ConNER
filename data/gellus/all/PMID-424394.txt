[Histophysiology and histopathology of the adrenals in experimental hypokinesia].
In experiments on male rats in the course of 3-month hypokinesia phasic changes were observed in the relative adrenal gland weight, in the volume of the cell nuclei of the glomerular, fasicular zones and the medulla, in the activity of the succinic dehydrogenase, alkaline and acid phosphatases, in the RNA and catecholamine content. These changes are associated with variations in the secretion and biosynthesis of the hormones of the cortical and the medullary layer of the adrenal glands during the hypokinetic stress development.

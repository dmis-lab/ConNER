Representative PCR/LDR results for HPTs in fimX, BP0059, BP0880, sphB2, ptxA, and bhuR. Raw capillary electrophoresis data for ligation products (green) and molecular weight standards (red) displayed as if an electrophoretic gel image. Assayed locus is indicated at the top of each panel; strain and length of its HPT allele are noted above each lane. Representative LDR results are depicted here; for complete data from all strains see Additional files 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. BP0880, BP0059, fimX, and sphB2 HPTs were screened by uniplex LDR reactions containing only the discriminating oligonucleotide that targets the Tohama I sequence. The ptxA and bhuR HPTs were screened by multiplex reactions that contain all three discriminating oligonucleotides. Letters in teal indicate molecular weight standards as labeled in the corresponding supplementary figures. Ligation products (arrows) are labeled using the notation described in the legend to Figure 1. The open arrowhead indicates a synthesis artifact in the BP0059 common oligonucleotide preparation.

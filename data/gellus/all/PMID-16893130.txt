[Autologous bone marrow stem cell or peripheral blood endothelial progenitor cell therapy in patients with peripheral limb ischaemia]
No effective medical therapies have been developed sofar to enhance blood flow in the legs of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). For patients with limb threatening ischaemia the only option for relief of rest pain or gangraena is amputation. There is evidence in experimental and clinical studies that adult bone marrow-derived stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells participate in the development of new blood vessels, called neoangiogenesis or neovascularization. Clinical results induced by autologous bone marrow stem cells or angiogenic growth/differentiation factors in end-stage patients with PAD are summarized. Considering the relatively few number of patients treated by angiogenic therapy, the interpretation of clinical results needs cautiousness.

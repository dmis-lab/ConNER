Arteriogenesis: the development and growth of collateral arteries.
In patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, collateral vessels bypassing major arterial obstructions have frequently been observed. This may explain why some patients remain without symptoms or signs of ischemia. The term "arteriogenesis" was introduced to differentiate the formation of collateral arteries from angiogenesis, which mainly occurs in the ischemic, collateral flow-dependent tissue. Many observations in various animal models and humans support that the remodeling of preexisting collateral vessels is the mechanism of collateral artery formation. This remodeling process seems to be mainly flow-mediated. It involves endothelial cell activation, basal membrane degradation, leukocyte invasion, proliferation of vascular cells, neointima formation (in most species studied), and changes of the extracellular matrix. The contribution of ischemia to arteriogenesis is still unclear, but arteriogenesis clearly can occur in the absence of any significant ischemia. It is questionable, whether collateral arteries also form de novo in ischemic vascular diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms of arteriogenesis will be important for the design of more effective strategies for the treatment of patients with ischemic vascular diseases.

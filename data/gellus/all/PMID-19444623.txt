Activated platelets enhance ovarian cancer cell invasion in a cellular model of metastasis. 
Increased platelet counts and systemic coagulation activation are associated with ovarian cancer progression. Platelet activation occurs in the tumor microenvironment and may influence local invasion and metastasis. We used a cellular model of tumor invasion to investigate the effect of activated platelets on the human ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3. SKOV3 cells were exposed to washed, thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-activated or TRAP-naive platelets under various experimental conditions, and tumor cell invasion was assayed in Matrigel chambers. The effect of platelets on the content of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and VEGF in SKOV3 cell conditioned medium was measured using an ELISA assay. TRAP-activated platelets stimulated a dose-dependent increase in SKOV3 cell invasion. Exposure to activated platelet membranes and to soluble proteins contained in activated platelet releasate both contributed to the observed increase in invasion. The inhibition of platelet activation with prostaglandin E1 (PGE(1)) attenuated the invasive capacity of SKOV3 cells. Exposure to platelets resulted in significantly increased uPA and VEGF content of SKOV3 cell conditioned medium. Activated platelets enhance SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cell invasion through Matrigel and increase the amount of uPA and VEGF secreted into SKOV3 cell conditioned medium. If generalizable to additional cell lines and human disease, this observation may partially explain the adverse prognosis associated with thrombocytosis in ovarian cancer. Platelets, therefore, may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention in human ovarian cancer.

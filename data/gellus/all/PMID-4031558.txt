Postpartum rubella immunization: association with development of prolonged arthritis, neurological sequelae, and chronic rubella viremia.
Six women developed chronic long-term arthropathy after postpartum immunization against rubella. All individuals developed acute polyarticular arthritis within 12 days to three weeks postimmunization and have had continuing chronic or recurrent arthralgia or arthritis for two to seven years after vaccination. Acute neurological manifestations, consisting of carpal tunnel syndrome or multiple paresthesiae, developed postvaccination in three women. Two have developed continuing active or chronic recurrent episodes of blurred vision, paresthesiae, and painful limb syndromes together with recurrent joint symptoms. Chronic rubella viremia has been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (MNC) populations in five of the six women up to six years after vaccination. In addition rubella virus was isolated from breast milk MNCs in one individual at nine months postvaccination and from peripheral blood MNCs in two of four breast-fed infants studied at 12-18 months of age. Immune responses to rubella virus studied at sequential intervals after vaccination correlated with development of rheumatologic and neurological manifestations.

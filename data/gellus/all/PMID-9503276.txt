Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and thrombopenia in a patient with dopaminergic psychosis.
In patients with Parkinson' disease and dopaminergic psychosis, clozapine treatment is recommended as the drug is free from extrapyramidal side effects and does not worsen motor symptoms of the underlying disease. The use of clozapine, however, is limited due to its hematotoxic side effects. For treatment of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) are recommended. We report the case of a 72-years-old male patient with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and thrombopenia. Neutropenia was successfully treated with G-CSF, but thrombopenia persisted and resolved spontaneously after 14 days. Bone marrow toxicity of clozapine is not restricted to white cell maturation, but may also impair thrombocytopoesis.

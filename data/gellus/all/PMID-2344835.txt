Amplification of mineralocorticoid activity of aldosterone by 18-hydroxy-corticosterone and 18-hydroxy-19-nor-corticosterone in adrenalectomized rats.
A combination of aldosterone (1 micrograms) with either 18-OH-corticosterone (1 micrograms) or 18-OH-19-norcorticosterone (1 micrograms) injected to adrenalectomized rats indicated an amplification of mineralocorticoid activity as expressed by Na/K ratio in urine. Without aldosterone their mineralocorticoid potency was negligible.

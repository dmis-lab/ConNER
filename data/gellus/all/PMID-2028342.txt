Posterior stabilization of the cervical spine with hook plates.
Hook-plate fixation is designed for posterior cervical stabilization from C2 to C7. Indications remain the same as for standard posterior fixations. The prime indications are discoligamentous injuries. The plates are hooked under the lower laminas and attached to the articular masses of the upper vertebra by oblique screws. An H-graft is placed between the spinous processes. The vertebrae are compressed together by the plates at three points, the facet joints, and graft. The resulting pre-stressed system is stable in all directions. A protocol for safe reduction of cervical dislocations is observed. Of 70 patients treated from 1979 to 1986, 51 were examined 12-54 months after surgery. All fusions consolidated. Two neurologic complications not attributable to the fixation occurred. Other major complications were not seen.

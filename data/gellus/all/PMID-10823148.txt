Application of microsatellite PCR techniques in the identification of mixed up tissue specimens in surgical pathology.
A fragment of tumour was erroneously mixed up with an endometrial biopsy. Micro-satellite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clearly demonstrated the extraneous nature of the fragment. Micro-satellite PCR may be useful for the identification of mis-labelled or mismatched tissue fragments in surgical pathology specimens.

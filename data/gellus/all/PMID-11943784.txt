Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 activation by aerobic glycolysis implicates the Warburg effect in carcinogenesis. 
Cancer cells display high rates of aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known historically as the Warburg effect. Lactate and pyruvate, the end products of glycolysis, are highly produced by cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen. Hypoxia-induced gene expression in cancer cells has been linked to malignant transformation. Here we provide evidence that lactate and pyruvate regulate hypoxia-inducible gene expression independently of hypoxia by stimulating the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible Factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). In human gliomas and other cancer cell lines, the accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein under aerobic conditions requires the metabolism of glucose to pyruvate that prevents the aerobic degradation of HIF-1alpha protein, activates HIF-1 DNA binding activity, and enhances the expression of several HIF-1-activated genes including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 3, and aldolase A. Our findings support a novel role for pyruvate in metabolic signaling and suggest a mechanism by which high rates of aerobic glycolysis can promote the malignant transformation and survival of cancer cells.

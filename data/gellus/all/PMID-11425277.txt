Current prospects for controlling cancer growth with non-cytotoxic agents--nutrients, phytochemicals, herbal extracts, and available drugs.
In animal or cell culture studies, the growth and spread of cancer can be slowed by many nutrients, food factors, herbal extracts, and well-tolerated, available drugs that are still rarely used in the clinical management of cancer, in part because they seem unlikely to constitute definitive therapies in themselves. However, it is reasonable to expect that mechanistically complementary combinations of these measures could have a worthwhile impact on survival times and, when used as adjuvants, could improve the cure rates achievable with standard therapies. The therapeutic options available in this regard include measures that: down-regulate serum free IGF-I; suppress the synthesis of mevalonic acid and/or certain derivatives thereof; modulate arachidonate metabolism by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, or COX-2; antagonize the activation of AP-1 transcription factors; promote the activation of PPAR-gamma transcription factors; and that suppress angiogenesis by additional mechanisms. Many of these measures appear suitable for use in cancer prevention.

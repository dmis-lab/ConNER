Effect of 1-alkylpyrrolidine N-oxides on energy metabolism of cancer cells.
The main purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of a homologous series of 1-alkylpyrrolidine N-oxides on ATP-producing processes in Ehrlich ascites and L1210 murine leukemia cells. The effect on aerobic glucose consumption, lactic acid formation, content of total (T-SH) and non-protein thiol groups (NP-SH), endogenous respiration and the level of ATP in tumor cells incubated in vitro was investigated. 1-Tetradecylpyrrolidine N-oxide (TPNO), one of the most active compounds, immediately after addition to the suspension of Ehrlich cells in an ice bath, decreased the level of ATP to the same extent over the whole concentration range. After 2 h incubation at 37 degrees C the drop in the ATP level was lower. The decrease in ATP level might be explained through the interaction of the amine oxide with the cell membrane integrity.

Patients and Study Design
A prospective evaluation of the different CMR parameters for predicting LV segmental and global functional recovery was performed in 46 patients (63 +/- 10 years old, 3 with previous CABG, 35 with three-vessel disease, 3 with one-vessel disease) with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35 +/- 8%) before they underwent surgical (n = 34) or percutaneous (n = 12) revascularisation. Sixty patients without contraindications for CMR were screened for the following inclusion criteria: (1) CAD (> 70% stenosis in one or more major epicardial vessels), scheduled for a revascularisation procedure; (2) LVEF <= 45%; (3) at least two adjacent segments with wall motion abnormalities at rest; and (4) no infarction or revascularisation within the last two months. Patients were included in the study only after a successful and complete coronary revascularisation. Of the 14 patients who did not complete the study, 3 decided not to undergo the repeated CMR scan or were lost during follow-up; 7 had significant periprocedural injury (new LGE zones on repeated CMR scans and clinically proven periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) or MI between both scans); 3 had pacemakers or defibrillators implanted in the period between the MR scans; and 1 was excluded because of dilated cardiomyopathy with secondary CAD. None of the patients were excluded from the study for technical reasons or image quality.
The mean interval between CMR and revascularisation was 12 +/- 13 days, and none of the patients presented clinical evidence of infarction during this period. The mean interval between MI and the first CMR was 3.6 years. In 46 patients, the extent of regional contractility and LGE were determined repeatedly by CMR 28 +/- 4 weeks (6 months) after revascularisation.
The study was approved by the Lithuanian Bioethics Committee (Nr. 17), and informed written consent was obtained from each patient prior to inclusion in the study.

Angiogenesis in the caprine caruncles in non-pregnant and pregnant normal and swainsonine-treated does.
Microvascular corrosion casts of caruncles from non-pregnant and pregnant doe goats at 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 18 weeks were examined with scanning electron microscopy. The internal convex surface of the caruncles of non-pregnant does was covered with capillary meshes of regular diameter and form, without crypts. As pregnancy advanced the complexity of the vasculature increased: at 4 weeks the surface showed a pattern of ridges separated by troughs. At later stages, branches of radial arteries penetrated the periphery forming an extensive mesh of capillaries on the concave surface. Capillary diameters increased significantly during pregnancy, especially after 4 weeks, when large flattened sinusoids formed. These sinusoids had a great deal of surface area for potential contact with the fetal component. The caprine placenta is usually considered to have increased interhemal distance compared with endotheliochorial and hemochorial types: our results suggest that the very extensive development of sinusoids and crypts may compensate for any negative consequences of the placental architecture. Placental angiogenesis, which is physiologically normal, may serve as a general model of this process in other circumstances, such as tumor. The effect of swainsonine (active compound of locoweed and a potential anticancer drug) on vascular development showed no differences in sinusoidal diameters at 7 weeks, but a decrease in capillary density was noted. Swainsonine caused a great distortion to the vasculature at 18 weeks. The effects of this compound on the vascular development lend credibility to its potential as an anticancer agent.

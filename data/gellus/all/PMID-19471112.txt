Cisplatin reduces endothelial cell migration via regulation of type 2-matrix metalloproteinase activity.
AIMS: In this study we investigated the effect of cisplatin on endothelial cell migration, an essential process for vascular remodeling and regeneration in several physiological and pathological situations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with cisplatin and endothelial cell migration analyzed by fluorescence and scratch-wound migration assay. MMP2 and MMP9 activity were determined by zymographic assay, and MAPK activation by Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that cisplatin provoked a time- and dose-dependent decrease of HUVEC migration; this effect was clearly independent from its well known cytotoxic activity. In addition, cisplatin markedly reduced MMP2 activity in both conditioned media and cell lysates, increased p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation, but did not affect ERK phosphorylation. Endothelial cell migration was attenuated by treatment of cells with GM6001, a non-specific inhibitor of MMPs, or by a selective anti-MMP2 antibody. However, treatment of cells with SB202190 or SP600125, inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK respectively, did not affect HUVEC migration. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that cisplatin induced a reduction of endothelial cell migration through an inhibition of MMP2 activity by downstream signal transduction pathways independent of JNK and p38 MAPK activation.

Regulation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling and vascular diseases.
PURPOSE: Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily play critical roles in regulation of various cellular functions. Dysregulation of the signaling mechanisms of the TGF-beta superfamily proteins is associated with clinical diseases such as cancer, fibrotic diseases, and vascular disorders. Therefore, understanding these signaling mechanisms may provide us with novel ways to develop strategies for treating clinical diseases induced by these cytokines. METHODS: This review discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling, focusing on the roles of TGF-beta in regulation of vascular wall cells and on the regulation of TGF-beta superfamily signals by inhibitory Smads.

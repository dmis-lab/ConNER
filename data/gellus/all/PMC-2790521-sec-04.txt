Contrary to previous reports that PON1 activities plateau by 2 years of age, we observed an age-dependent increase in all three PON1 measures from birth through 7 years of age (p < 0.0001). The PON1192 genotype significantly modified the effect of age on paraoxonase (POase) activity (p < 0.0001) such that increases in enzyme activity with age were influenced by the number of R alleles in a dose-dependent manner. Children with the PON1-108CC192RR diplotype had significantly higher mean PON1 activities and also experienced steeper increases of POase activity over time compared with children with the PON1-108TT192QQ diplotype.

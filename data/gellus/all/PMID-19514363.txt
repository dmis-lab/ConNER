[Role of the tumor suppressor ARF in oncogenesis]
The paper reviews the data available in the literature on a role of the tumor suppressor ARF in oncogenesis and considers the structure of a gene encoding ARF protein. The p53-dependent and p-53-independent functions of this protein are under many studies. There is evidence for the implication of ARF in angiogenesis. There is more and more information on the role of ARF in the regulation of a cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. The importance of this tumor suppressor in the mechanisms of carcinogenesis is beyond question as the inactivation of ARF suppressor activity leads to the rapid growth of neoplasia. However, the exact mechanisms of ARF action yet remain unclear and require further studies by different specialists at both the molecular genetic and other levels of investigation.

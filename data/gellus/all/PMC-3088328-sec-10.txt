Etymology.
Professor Stephen Lane Wood worked extensively on collections of Scolytinae preserved in Indian museums, and described a number of new Scolytinae species from India. In this paper we describe one more new bark-beetle species from India kept in the Natural History Museum in Vienna (NHMW) and dedicate this species to the late Professor Stephen Lane Wood.

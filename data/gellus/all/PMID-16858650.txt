Heparin immobilized porous PLGA microspheres for angiogenic growth factor delivery.
PURPOSE: Heparin immobilized porous poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres were prepared for sustained release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to induce angiogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porous PLGA microspheres having primary amine groups on the surface were prepared using an oil-in-water (O/W) single emulsion method using Pluronic F-127 as an extractable porogen. Heparin was surface immobilized via covalent conjugation. bFGF was loaded into the heparin functionalized (PLGA-heparin) microspheres by a simple dipping method. The bFGF loaded PLGA-heparin microspheres were tested for in vitro release and in vivo angiogenic activity. RESULTS: PLGA microspheres with an open-porous structure were formed. The amount of conjugated amine group onto the microspheres was 1.93+/-0.01 nmol/mg-microspheres, while the amount of heparin was 95.8 pmol/mg-microspheres. PLGA-heparin microspheres released out bFGF in a more sustained manner with a smaller extent of initial burst than PLGA microspheres, indicating that surface immobilized heparin controlled the release rate of bFGF. Subcutaneous implantation of bFGF loaded PLGA-heparin microspheres in mice significantly induced the formation of new vascular microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: PLGA microspheres with an open porous structure allowed significant amount of heparin immobilization and bFGF loading. bFGF loaded PLGA-HP microspheres showed sustained release profiles of bFGF in vitro, demonstrating reversible and specific binding of bFGF to immobilized heparin. They also induced local angiogenesis in vivo in an animal model.

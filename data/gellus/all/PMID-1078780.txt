Abdominal approach for the ligation of bleeding oesophageal varices.
The conventional surgical treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices in the emergency situation is based upon the Boerema-Crile operation of transthoracic oesophagotomy and ligation of the varices. This and the other methods of treatment of this condition in current practice are discussed. Two cases are reported in which a transabdominal oesophagogastrotomy was used to approach the site of bleeding. This operation is described and the theoretical and practical advantages it appears to offer over the standard approach are considered.

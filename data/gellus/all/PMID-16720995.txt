GDP and AGE receptors: mechanisms of peritoneal damage.
Long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) is limited by morphological changes of the peritoneal membrane. Structural changes were promoted by toxicity of glucose degradation products (GDPs) which are generated during heat sterilization in peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs). Besides their direct toxicity GDPs promote formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). RAGE (receptor for AGE) is the best characterized signal transduction receptor for AGEs and is expressed on mesothelial cells. The effects of PDFs with different amounts of GDPs were compared on morphological changes in the peritoneal membrane in a RAGE -/- mouse model. It could be demonstrated that RAGE plays a pivotal role in structural damage (e.g. inflammation, neoangiogenesis and fibrosis) of the peritoneal membrane. Further investigations of this pathway with regard to preventing peritoneal fibrosis should be performed to maintain the integrity of the peritoneal membrane in peritoneal dialysis patients.

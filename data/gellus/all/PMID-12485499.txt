[Expression and mutation of c-kit gene in gastrointestinal stromal tumor]. 
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the expression and mutation of c-kit gene and its relationship with clinical pathology and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). METHODS: Immunohistochemical and PCR-SSCP techniques were used to detect c-kit protein expression and c-kit gene exon 11 mutation in 82 patients with GIST. RESULTS: The positive c-kit protein expression and c-kit gene mutation rates were 97.6% (80/82) and 41.5% (34/82). Correlating the results of these two methods and clinicopathological factors, the c-kit expression and c-kit gene mutation rates were 95.0% (19/20) and 0 in benign GIST, and were 98.4% (61/62), 54.8% (34/62) in malignant GIST. Mutation positive GIST showed higher frequency of adjacent tissue invasion, metastasis and recurrence as compared with mutation negative ones. CONCLUSION: c-kit protein is an important diagnostic marker of gastrointestinal stromal tumor. c-kit gene mutation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of GIST and also may be a prognostic marker.

Molecular characterization of angiogenic properties of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.
Little is known about the specificity of angiogenic properties of oral cancer cells and the possible mechanisms. Stimulatory effects on proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) characterized the angiogenic properties of oral cancer cells but not normal oral keratinocytes (NOK). ELISA found the presence of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) both in the tested oral cancer cells and NOK. Attenuation of the proangiogenic effects by neutralizing VEGF antibodies suggests VEGF play a key role in the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype in oral cancer cells. Western blotting of p53 and murine double mutant 2 (Mdm2) together with p53 DNA sequencing analysis indicate that p53 function loss by mutation or overexpression of Mdm2 occurred in all tested oral cancer cells regardless of their etiology. In summary, the angiogenic property of oral cancer cells is mediated by many factors in addition to VEGF and the functional status of p53.

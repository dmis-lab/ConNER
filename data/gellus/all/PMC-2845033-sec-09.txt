Applying A1C cut offs to the AusDiab population (4.6% undiagnosed diabetes)
Applying the same cut offs, a total 75.9% of the AusDiab population had diabetes ruled in or ruled out (Fig. 1B), while the remaining 24.1% had impaired A1C. From those with impaired A1C, 69.3% had abnormal glucose status. For diabetes, A1C at 5.5% provided moderate sensitivity (83.5%) but high NPV (99.0%), since diabetes prevalence was lower in the AusDiab than in the MP population. A1C at 7.0% gave 100% specificity and 100% PPV. By dropping the cut off to 6.5%, specificity remained 99.9%, with PPV near 100%.

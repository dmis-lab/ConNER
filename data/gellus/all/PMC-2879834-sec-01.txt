Summary
Kindt et al.1 published a report entitled "Intestinal immune activation in presumed post-infectious functional syspepsia" in the August issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility in 2009. By comparing the signs of inflammation and the degree of hyperplasia of the enterochromaffin cells (EC) in duodenal biopsies obtained from patients with presumed post-infectious functional dyspepsia (PI-FD) and unspecified-onset functional dyspepsia (U-FD), they showed that PI-FD is associated with persistence of focal T-cell aggregates, decrease in CD4+ cells and increased macrophage counts surrounding the crypts, without any significant differences in the numbers of EC or chromogranin A (CA)-positive cells (mast cells). This finding may indicate impaired ability of the immune system in these cases to terminate the inflammatory response after an acute insult.

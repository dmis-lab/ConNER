[Intraepithelial neoplasm of the uterine cervix and angiogenesis: morphologic study]
Thirty uterine cervix specimens sampled following conization or total hysterectomy were studied using histology, histoenzymology (vessel phosphatase alkaline activity), and immunohistochemistry (demonstration of laminin and type IV collagen in epithelium and vessel basement membranes). Pathologic conditions included dystrophia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and intraepithelial carcinoma. Results were compared to findings in a control group. We found that the severity of vascular abnormalities correlated positively with the severity of histologic epithelial lesions; this finding is consistent with colposcopic results. Anarchic angiogenesis with large, moniliform, tortuous vessels was seen in severe dysplasias and carcinomas. The vascular anomalies seem to precede the development of histologic lesions in some instances. Histogenesis of the abnormal vessels may involve production of an angiogenic factor by the cancerized epithelia.

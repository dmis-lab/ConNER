Rofecoxib as adjunctive therapy for haemophilic arthropathy.
Joint haemorrhage and subsequent haemophilic arthropathy are significant complications in haemophilia. The pathophysiology involves inflammation and angiogenesis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are anti-inflammatory agents, which have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and analgesic properties yet do not affect platelet function in the manner of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These properties make such agents potentially useful as adjunctive therapy in haemophilia. There is only one prior report describing rofecoxib treatment in a single haemophilia patient. Our objectives were to determine the safety and efficacy of rofecoxib in treating acute haemarthrosis, chronic synovitis, target joints and pain. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients treated with rofecoxib for acute haemarthrosis, chronic synovitis, target joint or pain. The safety and efficacy of rofecoxib treatment were determined based on subjective patient reports and physical examinations during follow-up clinic visits. A total of 28 patients between 3 and 37 years of age were treated for a total of 42 courses of rofecoxib treatment. All courses were evaluated for safety and 31 for efficacy. Rofecoxib was used for eight acute haemarthrosis, four target joints, seven cases of synovitis and 12 episodes of pain. Efficacy was demonstrated particularly for chronic synovitis and pain and no serious adverse events occurred. This is the largest study to date evaluating COX-2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy in haemophilia and suggests that these agents may be an important adjunctive therapy in the management of haemophilia.

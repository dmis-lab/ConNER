Melanoma/skin cancer screening clinics: experiences in The Netherlands.
In 1989 and 1990 we conducted two free melanoma/skin screening clinics in Oss and Arnhem in the Netherlands. The study was carried out along the lines of the recent campaigns supported by the American Academy of Dermatology. Of 2564 persons screened, 53 had melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer (2.1%). Compliance with follow-up for persons with suspected melanoma/skin cancer was adequate (93 of 103; 90.3%).

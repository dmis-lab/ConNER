Mitochondria in Cardiac Myocyte Apoptosis
It has been suggested that activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway leading to executioner casp activation is relevant in heart injury.1 The notion of participation of casp activation in adult cardiac myocyte apoptosis emerged from studies using immunofluorescence microscopy16 and casp inhibitors.37 Bahi et al.38 demonstrated that cardiomyocyte levels of all casps decrease with age, and they are very low in adult cardiac cells. Recently, Bae et al.39 reported that apoptosis can be induced in the heart lacking casp activation via casp-independent pathways, probably through apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways can be inhibited by the cytoprotective protein apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC). ARC inhibits the extrinsic pathway by interacting with casp 8 and components of the death-inducing signaling complex, such as FADD, whereas inhibition of the intrinsic pathway is mediated by blocking BAX activation and mitochondria translocation.40
AIF is anchored by its N terminus to the mitochondrial inner membrane, with its C terminus oriented toward the intermembrane space. AIF is required for oxidative phosphorylation and for the assembly and/or stabilization of respiratory complex I.41 Upon induction of apoptosis, AIF is cleaved and released into the cytosol, where it translocates to the nucleus and mediates chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation.41 However, this well-known pro-apoptotic action of AIF is in conflict with the observation that AIF is essential for the maintenance of normal heart function and its inactivation results in dilated C.42 Moreover, cardiac myocytes isolated from a mouse model with 80% reduction in AIF levels manifested increased cell death induced by oxidative stress, and the hearts of these mice displayed enhanced ischemic damage after in vivo I/R.43 Although it has been described that AIF is released from cardiac myocyte mitochondria during I/R, its contribution to I/R-induced apoptosis was discounted.38 However, AIF has been implicated in cardiac myocyte death induced by oxidative stress and HF.44
Endonuclease G (Endo G) is a nuclear-encoded endonuclease localized to the intermembrane space of mitochondria. In cardiac myocyte apoptosis, Endo G translocates to the nucleus, where it cleaves DNA. In heart and cultured cardiac myocytes, Endo G has a role in I/R-mediated cell death.38 Activation of the intrinsic pathway by the extrinsic apoptotic pathway can take place through casp-8-dependent cleavage of BCL2-interacting protein (BID) to truncated BID (t-BID). The C-terminal fragment of t-BID subsequently translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it presumably activates the intrinsic pathway. This pathway is operative in the heart.1

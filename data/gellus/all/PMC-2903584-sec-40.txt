Treatment for patients with diabetes
It is notable that treatment of diabetes has not been directly monitored by OECD indicators, largely due to complexity in data collection. Treatment is tailored for individuals depending on the patient's disease status, and plays a crucial role in diabetes management. Clinical trials have found that a one percentage point reduction in HbA1c levels would reduce micro-vascular complications by 25% to 30% [49,50] and a 10 mmHg reduction in blood pressure would decrease macro- and micro-vascular complications and death rates by 32% [51]. Improved control of blood lipids can reduce risk of coronary heart disease by 39% and risk of death by 43% [52].
RAND's Quality Assessment Tools System offers indicators relating to diabetes treatment [53], and application of these indicators in a national study in the US has provided insight into adherence to recommended treatment regimens. For people with newly diagnosed diabetes 56% received dietary and exercise counselling. In type 2 diabetes patients, use of oral hypoglycaemic agents for those inadequately controlled on dietary therapy was 38% and use of insulin for those inadequately controlled on oral hypoglycaemics was 39%. Fifty-five percent of diabetics were offered an ACE inhibitor within 3 months of the notation of proteinuria unless contraindicated.
The AusDiab study reported the treatment pattern among Australian adults with type 2 diabetes [37]. While 32% of diabetes patients were on diet regimen only, 58% used oral hypoglycaemic agents and diet only, and another 10% took insulin. Bailie and colleagues reported pharmaceutical interventions for diabetes patients in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory [54]. During the 3-years study period, 75-79% of Aboriginal patients took oral hypoglycaemic agents, and 4-7% used insulin.

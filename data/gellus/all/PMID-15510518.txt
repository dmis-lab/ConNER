[Glaucoma and ocular ischemic syndrome--case report]
PURPOSE: Ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) is often poorly diagnosed and treated as primary open angle glaucoma or later on, as neovascular glaucoma. We present a 54 year old male, treated topical since 23 years for glaucoma and sent to our clinic for trabeculectomy because of rapid worsening of vision on right eye with bilateral total excavation of optic disc. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational case report. RESULTS: Because of typical signs of IOS (iris neovascularization, mid-peripheral dot and blot hemorrhages in both eyes, narrowed arterioles in right eye, following examinations were performed: Doppler ultrasonography of carotid arteries, digital subtractional angiography of the carotid vessels and magnetic resonance angiography. The examinations showed occlusion of the right common carotid artery and with 80% stenosis of the left common carotid artery, occlusion of abdominal aorta. After phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens because of rapid intumescence cataract in the right eye, and endarterectomy of left external carotid artery, the neovascularization of the iris regressed in both eyes. CONCLUSION: In case of iris neovascularization or mid-peripheral hemorrhages the Doppler sonography of carotid arteries should be performed. Quick cooperation between ophthalmologist, radiologist and vascular surgeon following endarterectomy seems to stop progressing changes of ocular ischemic syndrome.

CONCLUSION
Intra-operative monitoring of partial pressure of tissue oxygen (PtiO2 ) is a very sensitive method of detecting the decrease of oxygen for cell utilization, due to decreased blood flow, during temporary clipping and after definitive clipping, in middle cerebral artery incidental unruptured aneurysm surgery. "Basal values", obtained without the influence of subarachnoid blood, were lower than expected in "uninjured" brain, and this fact, although unexplained, should be kept in mind in future investigation in this field. Although values that could be predictive of brain ischemia could not be established, an incomplete recovery or continuous decrease in PtiO2 values after definitive clipping should be considered an indicator of high risk for the development of post-operative brain infarction, and, therefore, an indication for verification of the position of the clip.

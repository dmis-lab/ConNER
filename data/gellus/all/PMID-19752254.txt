Magnesium for treatment of asthma in children.
QUESTION: Magnesium is considered adjuvant therapy for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in adults, but can it be used to treat children? ANSWER: Magnesium seems to be beneficial in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in children. It is a safe drug to administer, but there have been minor side effects reported, such as epigastric or facial warmth, flushing, pain and numbness at the infusion site, dry mouth, malaise, and hypotension. Owing to its bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects, magnesium is an encouraging adjuvant therapy for pediatric patients who do not respond to conventional treatment in acute severe exacerbations. Future studies should focus on establishing the optimal dosage for maximal benefits and the best route of administration. Magnesium should also be considered as a prophylactic treatment.

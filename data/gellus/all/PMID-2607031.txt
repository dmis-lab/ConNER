Screening method for insecticidal activity using first instars of black blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae).
A bioassay method suitable for rapid mass screening of fermentation and synthetic organic compounds for insecticidal activity is described. The test, which uses first instars of susceptible black blow fly, Phormia regina (Meigen), in a bovine serum medium, detects insecticidal activity with reproducible results. It is capable of selecting the most active compound in structure-activity relationships by minimum effective dose concentration studies. The bioassay system is easy to operate and requires only a minute quantity of chemical compound.

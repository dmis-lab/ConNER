Basilar papilla
The basilar papilla is found in a recess that opens into the saccular space at one end, and is limited by a thin contact membrane at the other. The contact membrane separates the endolymphatic fluid in the papillar recess from the perilymphatic fluid at the round window (Lewis and Narins 1999; Wever 1985). The recess perimeter is roughly oval in shape; in the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, its major axis is approximately 200 mum long, while the minor axis measures approximately 150 mum (Van Bergeijk 1957). In the leopard frog, Rana pipiens pipiens, it is of similar size (personal observation, RLMS & JMS).
The oval perimeter of the lumen is formed from limbic tissue; a substance unique to the inner ear, and similar to cartilage (Wever 1985). The sensory epithelium is approximately 100 mum long. It occupies a curved area that is symmetrical in the major axis of the elliptical lumen. It contains approximately 60 hair cells (measured in Rana catesbeiana), from which the stereovilli protrude into the lumen and connect to the tectorial membrane (Frishkopf and Flock 1974). Typically the orientation of the hair cells, as defined by the direction to which the v-shape of the stereovilli bundle points (Lewis et al. 1985), is away from the sacculus in Ranidae.
The tectorial membrane spans the lumen of the papillar recess. It occludes about half the lumen, and consequently takes an approximately semi-circular shape when viewed from the saccular side (Frishkopf and Flock 1974; Wever 1985). The membrane has pores at the surface closest to the epithelium, into which the tips of the hair bundles project (Lewis and Narins 1999).4

Comment on "Why reduced-form regression models of health effects versus exposures should not replace QRA: livestock production and infant mortality as an example," by Louis Anthony (Tony) Cox, Jr., Risk Analysis 2009, Vol. 29, No. 12.
While a recent paper by Cox in this journal uses as its motivating factor the benefits of quantitative risk assessment, its content is entirely devoted to critiquing Sneeringer's article in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics. Cox's two main critiques of Sneeringer are fundamentally flawed and misrepresent the original article. Cox posits that Sneeringer did A and B, and then argues why A and B are incorrect. However, Sneeringer in fact did C and D; thus critiques of A and B are not applicable to Sneeringer's analysis.

Dendrimer-templated Fe nanoparticles for the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes by plasma-enhanced CVD.
A fourth-generation (G4) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (G4-NH2) has been used as a template to deliver nearly monodispersed catalyst nanoparticles to SiO2/Si, Ti/Si, sapphire, and porous anodic alumina (PAA) substrates. Fe2O3 nanoparticles obtained after calcination of the immobilized Fe3+/G4-NH2 composite served as catalytic "seeds" for the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by microwave plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD). To surmount the difficulty associated with SWNT growth via PECVD, reaction conditions that promote the stabilization of Fe nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced SWNT selectivity and quality, have been identified. In particular, in situ annealing of Fe catalyst in an N2 atmosphere was found to improve SWNT selectivity and quality. H2 prereduction at 900 degrees C for 5 min was also found to enhance SWNT selectivity and quality for SiO2/Si supported catalyst, albeit of lower quality for sapphire supported catalyst. The application of positive dc bias voltage (+200 V) during SWNT growth was shown to be very effective in removing amorphous carbon impurities while enhancing graphitization, SWNT selectivity, and vertical alignment. The results of this study should promote the use of exposed Fe nanoparticles supported on different substrates for the growth of high-quality SWNTs by PECVD.

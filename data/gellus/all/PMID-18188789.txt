[Photodynamic therapy in severe chronic central serous chorioretinopaty]
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) in chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic CSC, with clinical evidence of activity and treated with Photodynamic Therapy, are included in this report. All were assessed by a complete ophthalmological examination, including assessment of the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using an ETDRS chart, fluorescein and indocyanine angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The main objective of the study was to determine the mean visual acuity change. RESULTS: 11 eyes of 11 patients were included in the study, which had a mean follow-up period of 11 months. The mean BCVA increased from 20/76 to 20/64. 35% of eyes improved their BCVA by 2 lines or more, 45% remained stable and 18% lost 2 lines or more. Choroidal hyperpermeability was reduced in every case. Neurosensorial retinal detachment decreased in 80% of cases. Only one eye received a second PDT treatment due to choroidal neovascularization. An increase of atrophy over the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) was observed in another patient. CONCLUSIONS: PDT can reduce the clinical signs of activity, such as choroidal hyperpermeability or neurosensorial retinal detachment, in patients affected by chronic CSC. However, the increase in visual acuity is variable, probably due to the extent of RPE damage.

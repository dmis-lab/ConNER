[Treatment of squamous intraepithelial lesion of type CIN2 et CIN3 with laser CO2 vaporization: retrospective study of 52 cases].
OBJECTIVES:
This study was carried out over an 8-year period in order to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of laser CO2 vaporization in the treatment of squamous intraepithelial lesion of type CIN2 and CIN3.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
A retrospective study of 52 cases of cervical lesions of type CIN2 and CIN3 treated in first intention by laser CO2 vaporization was carried out at the hospital Jeanne-de-Flandre in CHRU of Lille from 1996 to 2003. This treatment was performed on only high-grade exo-cervical lesions, of small size (<2cm2), after a complete colposcopic examination.
RESULTS:
Fifty-two patients were treated by first-intention laser vaporization only. Mean age was 29.4 years and 51.9% were nulliparous. At the first cyto-colposcopic control, there were 17 persistent lesions (32.7%). Among the 35 patients without persistent lesion, 29 achieved cure (absence of recurrence), 4 presented a recurrence and 2 were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION:
The current data of the literature concerning the treatment by laser CO2 vaporization authorize application of this method for certain high-grade exocervical lesions after a complete colposcopic examination. This type of treatment remains less aggressive than a surgical treatment. The high rate of residual lesions in particular in the event of CIN3 can be due to an incomplete destruction of the lesion. Patients should thus be advised that monitoring is an integral part of the treatment. Laser vaporization could be limited to CIN1 and CIN2 lesions.

Subject disposition.
Data from 110 enrolled subjects were eligible for analysis. The demographics of the study subjects, by site, are recorded in Table 1. The population studied was predominantly not HIV infected (92%), and by the study entry criteria, their probability of infection was considered to be low. The risk categories assigned at the time of study entry were combined into groups for analysis, based on the predisposition for PCP. The analysis groups were as follows: (i) HIV/AIDS, (ii) lung transplant (one subject with a dual organ transplant [lung/kidney] was included in this category), (iii) all other organ transplants and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), (iv) leukemia, other hematological disorders, and autologous HSCT, (v) other solid tumors, and (vi) other nonmalignant conditions.

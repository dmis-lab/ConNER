Conclusion
RLs are new actors in animal and plant defense and their low toxicity and biodegradability make them promising molecules to be used against pathogens. In this respect, there are some clues now available for the success of RL applications in greenhouses to fight phytopathogens. A better understanding of RL mode of action, especially their perception and the signaling pathways activated, will be very important to potentiate their beneficial effects in plants. RLs have a dual mode of action: they are antimicrobial and also stimulate plant defense responses. This dual property is probably very important for the efficiency of new biopesticides. In animals, the use of RLs is also at an advanced stage. RLs are successfully used as antimicrobial agents, especially for skin disease treatment. Deep insight into the physiochemical effects of RLs and their biological importance would reveal new dimensions in the fields of research like agriculture and medicine, precisely in plant defense, disease control and pathogenesis. An understanding of bacterial genera producing RLs that are not yet well studied would provide light on these fascinating aspects.

NF-kappaB and IKK as therapeutic targets in cancer.
The transcription factor NF-kappaB and associated regulatory factors (including IkappaB kinase subunits and the IkappaB family member Bcl-3) are strongly implicated in a variety of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. A role for NF-kappaB in cancer cells appears to involve regulation of cell proliferation, control of apoptosis, promotion of angiogenesis, and stimulation of invasion/metastasis. Consistent with a role for NF-kappaB in oncogenesis are observations that inhibition of NF-kappaB alone or in combination with cancer therapies leads to tumor cell death or growth inhibition. However, other experimental data indicate that NF-kappaB can play a tumor suppressor role in certain settings and that it can be important in promoting an apoptotic signal downstream of certain cancer therapy regimens. In order to appropriately move NF-kappaB inhibitors in the clinic, thorough approaches must be initiated to determine the molecular mechanisms that dictate the complexity of oncologic and therapeutic outcomes that are controlled by NF-kappaB.

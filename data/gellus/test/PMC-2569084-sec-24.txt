Candle wicks
Candles with a lead metal core contribute to lead in the home (Nriagu and Kim 2000; van Alphen 1999). Exposure occurs both from air and from hand-to-mouth activity. However, to date, no children's EBLs traceable to candles have been reported. In 2002, the CPSC banned candlewicks containing > 0.06% lead (CPSC 2003).

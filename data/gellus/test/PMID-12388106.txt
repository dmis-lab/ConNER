Fibroblast growth factor 2 promotes microvessel formation from mouse embryonic aorta.
To delineate the roles that oxygen and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play in the process of angiogenesis from the embryonic aorta, we cultured mouse embryonic aorta explants (thoracic level to lateral vessels supplying the mesonephros and metanephros) in a three-dimensional type I collagen gel matrix. During 8 days of culture under 5% O(2), but not room air, the addition of FGF2 to explants stimulated the formation of Gs-IB(4-)positive, CD31-positive, and Flk-1-positive microvessels in a concentration-dependent manner. FGF2-stimulated microvessel formation was inhibited by sequestration of FGF2 via addition of soluble FGF receptor (FGFR) chimera protein or anti-FGF2 antibodies. FGFR1 and FGFR2 were present on explants. Levels of FGFR1, but not FGFR2, were increased in embryonic aorta cultured under 5% O(2) relative to room air. Our data suggest that low oxygen upregulates FGFR1 expression in embryonic aorta in vitro and renders it more responsive to FGF2.

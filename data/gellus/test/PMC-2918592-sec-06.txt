Breast cancer
The incidence of breast cancer is no higher than in the rest of the population. Tamoxifen should not be used as it may worsen symptoms [43].
Women need also specific management for treatment of HAE.
Short term prophylaxis: three options are available: attenuated androgens, tranexamic acid or C1Inh concentrate. There is no specific problem for the use of theses drugs for short course in female patients. In case of short term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens, no virilisation has been observed [44,45].
Acute attack treatment: there is no specific problem for the use of C1inh concentrate, tranexamic acid, icatibant; or ecallantide in female patients.

Sensitivity analysis of the influence of source-term and environmental parameters on the radiological risk of coal-fired plants.
A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the influence of different source-term and environmental parameters on the radiological risks from a coal-fired plant (CFP). It was found that the release rate of radionuclides and the effective release height most significantly influence radiological risk. Site characteristics, such as rain scavenging coefficients and food acquirement habits, have a lesser influence, and some parameters, such as time delay before ingestion of contaminated food, have practically no influence on the radiological impact of a CFP. The contribution to radiation risks of different exposure modes (i.e. inhalation, ingestion and contact with ground surface) were also analyzed, as well as of specific radionuclides and human body organs. Results of the sensitivity analysis were interpreted in terms of the characteristics of the fuel, facilities and site of a CFP. It is concluded that by proper choice of coal, furnace, ash filtration and stack height, as well as by proper siting, the radiological impact of a CFP can be drastically reduced.

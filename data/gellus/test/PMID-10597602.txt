Spacing effects on the memory for faces.
25 undergraduate women studied 12 stimulus pictures of female faces successively presented in spaced or massed conditions and made affective judgments for the pictures along a dimension of like to dislike. One week after the exposure (study) period, subjects were given an identification test comprised of photographs of the same female faces with different expressions. Analysis showed that the pictures presented in the spaced condition were more frequently and accurately identified than those presented under the massed condition and that affective judgment was unrelated to conditions of presentation.

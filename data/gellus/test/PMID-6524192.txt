[Reactive states among psychopathic personalities of different clinical groups].
On the basis of a clinical follow-up of 71 psychopaths with manifestations of reactive psychosis, the authors established the clinico-typological characteristics of both groups of pathology and the system of correlations between them. They also described the structure of the psychopathic and psychogenic syndromes, the type of psychopathic personality reaction and the form of psychogenic responses and proved statistically their close interrelationship. Data were obtained on some general regularities of interrelations of reactive psychoses with a psychopathic background which are important for the prognosis, prophylaxis and therapy of reactive states.

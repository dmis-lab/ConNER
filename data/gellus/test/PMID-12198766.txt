Protein expression profile of primary human squamous cell lung carcinomas indicative of the incidence of metastases. 
The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate firstly whether different protein expression patterns exist in primary squamous cell lung carcinomas of patients with and without lymph node involvement and secondly, whether or not different patterns exist in tumours with positive lymph nodes. For this reason, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 130 patients with squamous cell lung carcinomas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In a first step, proteins were selected which showed a relationship to lymph node involvement. The expression of JUN, ERBB2, MYC, cyclin D, PCNA, bFGF, VEGF and Hsp70 proteins revealed a positive correlation to lymph node involvement. In contrast, caspase-3, Fas ligand, Fas/CD95, and PAI showed an inverse correlation to lymph node involvement. In a second step, these parameters were further analyzed by hierarchical cluster analyses. The resulting clusters were correlated to patients with or without lymph node involvement. The data show that different protein expression patterns exist between primary squamous cell lung carcinomas with and without lymph node involvement and within carcinomas with lymph node involvement. The data suggest that various metastasis profiles exist.

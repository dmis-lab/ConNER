Reduced oncogenicity of p190 Bcr/Abl F-actin-binding domain mutants. 
The deregulated Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase is responsible for the development of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive leukemia in humans. To investigate the significance of the C-terminal Abl actin-binding domain within Bcr/Abl p190 in the development of leukemia/lymphoma in vivo, mutant p190 DNA constructs were used to generate transgenic mice. Eight founder and progeny mice of 5 different lines were monitored for leukemogenesis. Latency was markedly increased and occurrence decreased in the p190 del C lines as compared with nonmutated p190 BCR/ABL transgenics. Western blot analysis of involved hematologic tissues of the p190 del C transgenics with end-stage disease showed high-level expression of the transgene and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and Hef1/Cas, proteins previously shown to be affected by Bcr/Abl. These results show that the actin-binding domain of Abl enhances leukemia development but does not appear to be an absolute requirement for leukemogenesis.

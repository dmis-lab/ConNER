The role of syndecans in disease and wound healing.
Syndecans are a family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans widely expressed in both developing and adult tissues. Until recently, their role in pathogenesis was largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the reported involvement of syndecans in human cancers, infectious diseases, obesity, wound healing and angiogenesis. In some cancers, syndecan expression has been shown to regulate tumor cell function (e.g. proliferation, adhesion, and motility) and serve as a prognostic marker for tumor progression and patient survival. The ectodomains and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans can also act as receptors/co-receptors for some bacterial and viral pathogens, mediating infection. In addition, syndecans bind to obesity-related factors and regulate their signaling, in turn modulating food consumption and weight balance. In vivo animal models of tissue injury and in vitro data also implicate syndecans in processes necessary for wound healing, including fibroblast and endothelial proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization. These new insights into the involvement of syndecans in disease and tissue repair coupled with the emergence of syndecan-specific molecular tools may lead to novel therapies for a variety of human diseases.

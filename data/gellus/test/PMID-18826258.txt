Diverse cell signaling events modulated by perlecan.
Perlecan is a ubiquitous pericellular proteoglycan ideally placed to mediate cell signaling events controlling migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Its control of growth factor signaling usually involves interactions with the heparan sulfate chains covalently coupled to the protein core's N-terminus. However, this modular protein core also binds with relatively high affinity to a number of growth factors and surface receptors, thereby stabilizing cell-matrix links. This review will focus on perlecan-growth factor interactions and describe recent advances in our understanding of this highly conserved proteoglycan during development, cancer growth, and angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenic capacities of perlecan that involve proliferative and migratory signals in response to bound growth factors will be explored, as well as the anti-angiogenic signals resulting from interactions between the C-terminal domain known as endorepellin and integrins that control adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. These two somewhat diametrically opposed roles will be discussed in light of new data emerging from various fields which converge on perlecan as a key regulator of cell growth and angiogenesis.

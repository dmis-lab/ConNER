[Interleukin-18 and new drugs. Protective effect against tumor growth and infections]. 
IL-18, originally identified as interferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF), is related to the IL-1 family in terms of its structure as well as its processing, receptor, signal transduction pathway and pro-inflammatory properties. IL-18 is also functionally related to IL-12, as it induces the production of Th1 cytokines and participates in cell-mediated immune cytotoxicity. A summary is made of recent advances in the understanding of IL-18 structure, processing, receptor expression and immunoregulatory functions. It focuses on the role of IL-18 modulation in tumours, infections and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

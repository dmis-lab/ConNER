Immune consequences of burn injury.
The purpose of the immune system is to protect cells from invasion by microorganisms. The body has three equally important interactive immune defense systems, all of which are profoundly disrupted with major burn injury. The immune response to burn injury is immediate, prolonged, and severe. The end result in individuals surviving burn shock is immunosuppression, with increased susceptibility to potentially fatal systemic burn wound or pulmonary sepsis. Nursing actions to support the humoral and cell-mediated immune system of the burned patient include providing nutritional support to maintain serum protein levels at optimal levels; measures to decrease edema and promote angiogenesis in areas of partial-thickness injury; meticulous treatment of the wound to prevent infection and promote healing; monitoring of antibiotic use; conservative use of invasive techniques, including intubation and vascular access devices; maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance and body temperature; and energy conservation measures.

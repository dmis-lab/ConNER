Functional significance of VEGF-a in human ovarian carcinoma: role in vasculogenic mimicry.
Ovarian cancer is a silent killer, and shows early extensive tumor invasion and peritoneal metastasis. The microcirculation of most tumors includes cooperation of pre-existing vessels, intussusceptive microvascular growth, postnatal vasculogenesis, glomeruloid angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM). VM is critical for a tumor blood supply and is asscociated with aggressive features and metastasis. Our studies highlight the plasticity of aggressive human ovarian carcinoma cells and call into question the underlying significance of their ability to form VM in vitro induced by VEGF-a. These studies also show their clinicalpathological features of the cancers with human Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples. Results show that the process: VEGF-a-- greater than EphA2-- greater than MMPs-- greater than VM is the main pathway for VM formation and VEGF-a appears to play an important role in the formation of VM based on our in vitro assays and clinical immunohistochemical analyses. VM-targeting strategies for ovarian cancer include anti-VEGF-a treatment, knocking down the EphA2 gene and using antibodies against human MMPs if the tumor is VM positive. This strategy may be of significant value in laying the foundation for a more explicit anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy.

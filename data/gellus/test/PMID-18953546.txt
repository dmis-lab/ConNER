[Retinochoroidopathy after intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment]
A 74-year-old man presented with persistent metamorphopsias of the right eye 2 weeks after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab to treat choroidal neovascularization due to exudative age-related macular degeneration. The diagnosis reached was retinochoroiditis as an occult manifestation of sarcoidosis, possibly resulting from an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. The patient received a prescription for 100 mg Ultralan to be taken daily for 3 days and then tapered in 3 day steps. During the further course no deterioration of the condition was observed.

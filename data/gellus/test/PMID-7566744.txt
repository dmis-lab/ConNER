The LHRH pulse generator: a mediobasal hypothalamic location.
The location and mechanism of LHRH pulse generator are discussed based on our series of experiments. Suckling stimulus is a novel stimulus that inhibits LH pulses without any cooperation from ovarian steroids, unlike other stimuli such as stress, photoperiod etc. It is directly involved in suppressing the activity of the LHRH pulse generator. The information from teats suckled by pups or babies is conveyed dorsally to the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), where the LHRH pulse generator may be located. Experiments using various types of deafferentation and fetal brain tissue transplantation confirmed that the LHRH pulse generator is located in the MBH and suggested that LHRH pulse generator consists of nonLHRH neurons. Endogenous excitatory amino acid is one of the possible neurotransmitters that regulate LHRH release at the nerve terminal in ME.

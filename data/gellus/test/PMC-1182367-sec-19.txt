Figure 1
Allergen and particle dose-response experiments in BALB/cA and NIH mice Levels of serum OVA-specific IgE (A, D), IgG1 (B, E) and IgG2a (C, F) on day 26 after injection into one hind footpad of 100 (open columns), 50 (gray) or 10 (black) mug OVA combined with 100, 40, 10 or 0 mug PSP, or buffer (HBSS (hatched)), in BALB/cA (A, B, C) and NIH (D, E, F) mice. On day 21 the mice were boostered with the same OVA dose in the footpad. The PSP-control ("PSP ctr") group was given 100 mug PSP on day 0, followed by HBSS injection on day 21 (diamonds). Values (arbitrary units, AU) for individual mice (circles) and median values (columns) for groups of eight mice are shown. Dotted lines indicate the lower or higher detection limits for the ELISA assays. Note different scales for the two strains of mice.
Figure 2
The adjuvant effect of PSP on OVA-specific IgE and IgG2a responses in different strains of mice Levels of serum OVA-specific IgE (A) and IgG2a (B) on day 26 after injection into one hind footpad of HBSS (open columns), 10 mug OVA (gray), 40 mug PSP (hatched) or 10 mug OVA + 40 mug PSP (black) in different mouse strains. On day 21 all mice were boostered with 10 mug OVA in the footpad. Vertical straight lines indicate separate experiments. Values (arbitrary units, AU) for individual mice (circles) and median values (columns) for groups of mice are shown. Dotted lines indicate the lower detection limits for the ELISA assays. Brackets indicate statistically significant differences between groups (p < 0.05). All experiments were performed twice with similar results, with eight mice per group.
Figure 3
The primary cellular response in the draining lymph node The primary cellular response in the draining PLN was determined five days after a single injection of HBSS (open columns), 10 mug OVA (gray), 40 mug PSP (hatched) or 10 mug OVA + 40 mug PSP (black) into both hind footpads of BALB/cA, NIH and C3H/HeN mice. The total lymph node cell numbers (A) and IL-4 (B), IFN-gamma (C) and IL-10 (D) secreted from the PLN cells after ex vivo stimulation with Con A were determined. Values for individual samples (circles) and group median values (columns) are shown. Dotted lines indicate the lower detection limits for the cytokine ELISA assays, and brackets indicate statistically significant differences between groups (p < 0.05).

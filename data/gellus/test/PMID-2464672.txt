Experimental drug therapy of peritumoral brain edema.
Four drugs with potential anti-peritumoral brain edema activity were studied using the VX2 rabbit brain tumor model. Meclofenamate and indomethacin were tested in an attempt to confirm recent reports of anti-edema activity in non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's). The 'angiostatic' steroids 17 hydroxyprogesterone and epicortisol were tested because of their lack of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects and their structural similarity to glucocorticoids. The protein and water component of brain edema were indirectly quantitated. None of the test drugs demonstrated significant anti-edema activity. This work does not confirm reports that NSAID's have anti-edema activity and suggests that there may be no correlation between 'angiostatic' and anti-edema activity in certain steroid compounds.

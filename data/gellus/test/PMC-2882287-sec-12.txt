Temporary migration module
A temporary migration census module was conducted in 2002 and 2007. People who were identified as temporary migrants were entered into the module, and a household respondent answered questions about the migration. Key areas included the duration of migration, destination, reasons for migration, return pattern, communication pattern, remittances, linked moves and child care arrangements.

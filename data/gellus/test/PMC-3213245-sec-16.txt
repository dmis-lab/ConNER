Outcomes
The primary outcomes of this study are smoking abstinence rates post release as well as number of days to first cigarette after release. Seven day point-prevalence abstinence will be determined by combining self-reported tobacco use over the prior seven days and urine cotinine assays (below 200 ng/ml versus 200 or above). Participants with self-reported abstinence and cotinine levels below the cut-off will be classified as abstinent. Participants lost to follow-up will be considered non-abstinent. A secondary analysis will examine the effect of length of forced abstinence on quit rates.

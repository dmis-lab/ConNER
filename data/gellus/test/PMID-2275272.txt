[Biotechnological and biomedical aspects of production and study of metal cation-phospholipid complexes].
Problems relating to the technology of a phospholipid preparation from natural materials, liposome production, and studies into the mechanisms of interaction between metal (trace elements) cations and model bilayer lipid membranes are discussed. The proposed technology of extraction allows for preparation of phospholipids utilizable for liposome formation. The cation specificity of lipid bilayers is found to be determined by the presence of anionic phosphate adsorption sites on their surface.

UFT and its metabolites inhibit the angiogenesis induced by murine renal cell carcinoma, as determined by a dorsal air sac assay in mice.
UFT, an anticancer agent that is composed of tegafur (FT) and uracil at a molar ratio of 1:4, is widely used in clinical practice in Japan to treat cancer patients requiring a long-term chemotherapy, and it is associated with few side effects, if any. In this study, we have evaluated the inhibitory effect of UFT against RENCA cell-induced angiogenesis by a dorsal air sac assay. Marked angiogenesis is induced by implantation of a chamber containing RENCA cells into mice. In this model, UFT showed a strong angiogenesis-inhibitory effect, whereas 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and doxifluridine were less effective. Additional experiments revealed FT to be effective component of UFT; uracil remained ineffective in the inhibition of angiogenesis. Moreover, we have found that gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and gamma-butyrolactone, the metabolites of FT, possess a potent angiogenesis inhibitory effect that is amplified when the compounds are administered by a continuous infusion. This may reflect a transition in blood concentration of each metabolite resulting from the administration of UFT. Similar results were also obtained with respect to 5-FU. It was suggested that UFT has a stronger angiogenesis-inhibitory effect than did other fluorinated pyrimidines, partly due to its pharmacokinetic properties characterized by maintaining of higher and long-lasting blood levels of 5-FU and partly due the inhibitory effects derived from gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and gamma-butyrolactone, UFT-specific metabolites.

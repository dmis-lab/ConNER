Histopathological development of gastric tumors induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in rats. 
The development of carcinoma was examined in male Wistar rats (n = 120) exposed to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in the drinking water (83 micrograms/ml) for 16 weeks. After MNNG administration, rats were investigated by endoscopic observation, visualization of microvascular structure, and estimation of lectin binding sites. Changes of bile reflux to the stomach was observed endoscopically at 24 weeks as well as the development of gastric mucosal erosions. Protruding and expansive ulcerating carcinomas developed at 36 weeks and had a microvascular pattern similar to that of human adenocarcinoma. Estimation of lectin binding site and pattern was useful to evaluate the malignant potential of cell proliferation. We postulate that endoscopic observation is valuable in investigating the development of gastric carcinoma, and microvascular structure and lectin binding pattern may be useful to demonstrate the mechanism of growth of gastric carcinoma.

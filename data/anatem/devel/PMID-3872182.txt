New functions of epidermal growth factor: stimulation of capillary endothelial cell migration and matrix dependent proliferation.
The proliferative response of bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells to EGF is dependent upon attaching the cells to a matrix of fibronectin. Bovine capillary endothelial cells are also stimulated to actively migrate when exposed to EGF in vitro. These activities provide an explanation for the angiogenic properties of EGF in vivo. Capillary cell migration and proliferation are proposed as sensitive quantifiable bioassays to explore the functional domains of the EGF molecule. Studies on the inactivation of these properties of EGF by specific cleavage of the molecule with CNBr or proteases suggest that an intact loop composed in part by amino acid residues 20 to 31 is essential for at least some functions.

Rate of distraction calculation (Figs. 6, 7 and 8)
Ideal rate for new bone formation by distraction osteogenesis is known as 1 mm/ day.5,6 The slower rates may lead to premature consolidation, whereas the faster rates may result in poor regenerate bone formation. In simple longitudinal lengthening, the rate of distraction is equal at any point of the corticotomy, however, the rate of distraction at any given portion of the corticotomy varies during angular correction. Usually, the gap between corticotomized bone ends is larger on the concave side, therefore, the rate of angular correction should be adjusted so that the rate of distraction of the concave side is closer to 1 mm/day. In cases with passive hinge system, the amount of daily angular correction can easily be calculated by the geometric methods using the rule of similar triangles and the rule of concentric circles, and can be expressed as the amount of daily lengthening of motor system. In passive hinge system, the ACA is fixed on the frame in Ilizarov system or on the convex side of corticotomy in unilateral fixator system, and angular correction is achieved by changing the length of the motor (Ilizarov system) or the lengthener (unilateral fixator) which rotates the passive hinge. However, in active hinge system, angulator directly corrects angular deformity, and the lengthener and translator adjust secondary displacement. Therefore, the rate of angular correction cannot be determined by the simple geometric methods used for passive hinge system.
Regardless of types of fixators, the gap opens larger on the concave side of the deformity after realignment. The rate of angular correction also should be adjusted so that the rate of distraction of concave side is 1 mm/day. Theoretically, after realignment by Dyna-ATC with adjustment of secondary displacement, the convex side of the corticotomy does not change in length, but the cocave side opens to correct angular deformity. The amount of lengthening on the concave side can be calculated with the thickness of the bone at the corticotomy site and the amount of angular deformity (Fig. 6). If the corticotomy is performed on the CORA, no translation deformity happens, however, if not, translation results at the corticotomy site after realignment is achieved. The amount of translation can be calculated with the distance from the CORA to the corticotomy over the longitudinal bisecting line (lBL) (Fig. 6). On the immediate post-operative radiographs, the gap distance of concave side after realignment can be calculated with the expected change in length and translation on the concave side of the corticotomy using the Pythaorean theorem. The rate of angular correction should be given as the amount of daily correction angle, but not as the amount of length change of the fixator. The angular change of angulator determines the secondary change of length and translation of the corticotomy site. The amount of secondary deformity during angular correction can be calculated with the thickness of bone at the corticotomy site, the distance between the ACA and the corticotomy, and tan (a/2) (a is the amount of angular correction) (Fig. 6). The thickness of the bone at the corticotomy site and the distance between the ACA and the corticotomy do not change, once the corticotomy is performed after Dyna-ATC is applied. Therefore, the amount of secondary deformities changes only with tan (a/2) value. If tangent value varies proportionally with changes of angle, the gap distance increases constantly with the given amount of daily correction angle during angular correction. If not, the gap distance varies continuously with changes of the angle, therefore, the amount of correction angle should be readjusted everyday to maintain 1 mm/day of distraction rate on the concave side of the corticotomy. Fortunately, while the value of tangent angle increases exponentially especially over 45 degrees, tangent function curve is nearly straight, less than 30 degrees (Fig. 7). Therefore, in cases with less than 60 degrees of angular deformity, the amount of daily correction angle which permits 1 mm/day of distraction rate on the concave side of the corticotomy can be obtained as the rate of angular correction without daily adjustment during angular correction. Once the amount of daily angular correction is determined, the amount of daily length and translation compensation can also be calculated with the amount of daily angular correction.
Exact adjustment of secondary changes in length and translation at each angular correction opens the concave side of the corticotomy 1 mm per day, but allows minimal gap on the corticotomy of convex side especially in the early stage of angular correction. Therefore, it is possible that the corticotomized bone ends of convex side, may abut each other and prevent angular correction or adjustment of secondary translation. For the cases where the concomitant lengthening is required, longitudinal lengthening prior to angular correction is recommended. Otherwise, about 5 mm pre-lengthening and re-shortening after angular correction could be helpful in avoiding abutment on the convex side of the corticotomy site. Inappropriate sequence of angular correction and adjustment of secondary deformities could be one of the causes of the impingement. Appropriate sequence of correction is lengthening-translation-angulation with Dyna-ATC on the concave side and angulation-translation-shortening with Dyna-ATC on the convex side.

Retrospective case series of juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization treated with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin.
PURPOSE: To describe visual acuity and angiographic outcomes of juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treated with photodynamic therapy and verteporfin (PDT). METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four consecutive eyes of 446 patients treated with PDT from January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002, were identified from billing records. Fluorescein angiograms were reviewed retrospectively to identify juxtafoveal CNV. Eligible patients had CNV in which the central boundary of the lesion was between 1 and 199 microm from the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Patient charts were reviewed for visual acuity of the treated eye before PDT and at 6- and 12-month follow-up examinations. Presence of subfoveal CNV at 6 and 12 months of follow-up was determined by review of fluorescein angiograms. A lesion was considered subfoveal if it extended underneath the geometric center of the FAZ. RESULTS: Twenty-one eyes had juxtafoveal CNV. Median change in visual acuity both 6 and 12 months after the initial PDT was 0 lines (n = 18 at 6 months, range -14 to + 8 lines; n = 17 at 12 months, range -18 to + 7 lines). Eleven lesions progressed to a subfoveal location by 12 months. Visual acuity in eyes with progressive lesions decreased a median of 4 lines of vision. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a small sample size and limited length of follow-up, this study shows that visual acuity on average can remain stable for at least 12 months after PDT of juxtafoveal lesions. Growth through the foveal center still can occur, however, and this can be associated with substantial visual loss.

RESULTS
Forty Caucasians (19 females) with essential hypertension were enrolled in the study. Their mean age was 57 years. Most of them were overweight, 17 had metabolic syndrome according to the updated AHA NHLBI statement (defined as 3 or more of the following: waist circumference > 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women, blood pressure >= 130/85 mmHg, triglycerides > 150 mg/dl, HDL-C < 40 mg/dl in men and < 50 mg/dl in women, and fasting glucose >= 100 mg/dl), 8 had type 2 diabetes and 18 were smokers (Table 1).
Eprosartan reduced SBP by 8% (p<0.001) and DBP by 13% (p<0.001), while it had a neutral effect on the lipid profile and apolipoprotein levels (Table2).
Eprosartan did not affect plasma 8-epiPGF2a levels, whereas it significantly increased by 24% the lag time of total serum oxidation (145 +/- 54 min vs 180 +/- 58 min, p=0.001) (Table2). Eprosartan reduced by 14% the aspartate aminotransferase (form 21 to 18 U/L, p=0.04) and by 21% the alanine aminotransferase (from 24 to 19 U/L, p=0.05) activity (Table2).
The administration of eprosartan had no influence on glucose homeostasis, as well as on creatinine and uric acid levels (Table2). In addition, eprosartan did not affect clotting or fibrinolytic activity as this was estimated by PAI-1, tPA and a2-antiplasmin (Table2). The enzymatic activity of Lp-PLA2 and PON1 were not altered significantly following eprosartan treatment (Table2).

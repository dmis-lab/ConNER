NSPCs protect against 30 minute MCAO.
(A-D) Coronal histological sections through the ischemic striatum 3 days following MCAO, stained for TUNEL (A,B) or NeuN (C,D). Mice received intrastriatal injections of exogenous PBS (A,C) or EGFP+NSPCs (B,D,E) 72 hr prior to MCAO. Inset in (B) shows 40x magnified view of the injection site. (E) Monochrome conversion of image shown in B to demonstrate concentric ring structures used for Sholl analysis. (F) Quantification of TUNEL+ cells using Sholl analysis performed on fluorescent images. *p<0.05, n = 5 mice per group. Scale bar: A,B = 20 microm; C,D = 10 microm.

Assessment instruments
The SCID-I/P was administered by psychiatrists trained and certified in the use of all instruments in this study.
The ICG is a self-report instrument that can be used to identify CG when the total score is > 25, that demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94), and convergent and criterion validity [27]. The ICG total score also showed a fairly high association with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [32] total score (r = 0.67, P < 0.001), the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG) [33] score (r = 0.87, P < 0.001), and the Grief Measurement Scale (GMS) [34] score (r = 0.70, P < 0.001).
The ASA-27 is a self-report measure developed to rate separation anxiety symptoms in adult life (from 18 years of age). Principal components analysis revealed a coherent construct of adult separation anxiety with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95) and sound test-retest reliability (r = 0.86; P < 0.001). Further, a receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis against the semistructured interview yielded a high area under the curve (AUC) index of 0.9, suggesting that the questionnaire is an adequate alternative measure of adult separation anxiety [29].
The WSAS is a self-report scale of functional impairment that includes five questions rating interference of psychiatric symptoms in work, home management, social or private leisure activities, and ability to form and maintain close relationships with others. Each question is rated on a 0 to 8 scale with 0 indicating no impairment at all and 8 indicating very severe impairment. The Cronbach's alpha measure of internal scale consistency ranged from 0.70 to 0.94, the test-retest correlation was 0.73, and the WSAS interactive voice response administrations gave correlations of 0.81 and 0.86 with clinician interviews [30]. Correlations of WSAS with severity of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms were 0.76 and 0.61, respectively, and the scores were sensitive to patient differences in disorder severity and treatment-related change [30].
The MOODS-SR is an instrument developed and validated to assess lifetime mood spectrum symptoms [35], including manic and depressive features, rhythmicity and vegetative functions. The manic and depressive components are subtyped into mood, energy and cognition domains, focusing on manic or depressive symptoms, respectively. The rhythmicity and vegetative functions domain include changes in energy, physical wellbeing, mental and physical efficiency, related to the weather and season, and changes in appetite, sleep and sexual activities. The sum of the scores on the 3 manic domains (mood, energy, cognition) constitutes the 'manic component' (62 items) and that of the 3 depressive domains the 'depressive component' (63 items). The rhythmicity and vegetative functions domain includes 29 items. The instrument can be downloaded from http://www.spectrum-project.org.

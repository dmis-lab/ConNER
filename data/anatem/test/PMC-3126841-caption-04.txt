Confocal and scanning microscopic images of mammoth's and human hair.
Taphonomic changes, indicated by arrow-heads and straight white arrow in the confocal image. Bacterial-fungal colonies are shown by broken arrows. Red arrow indicates space between cuticle and hair shaft due to shrinkage. Extensive taphonomic changes in YUK are evident. Note the preservation of the cuticle in the human hair in contrast to the craters in the cuticles of the mammoth's hair. Bacterial biofilms are a feature of human hair; mammoth's hair was protected from bacterial invasion in permafrost.

Effect of Trail on the expression of endogenous M2. (A) Effect of Trail on the level of endogenous M2 protein. The expression level of endogenous M2 protein in HeLa cells was determined using western blot 4 h following Trail (250 mug/ml) treatment. (B) Effect of Trail on the endogenous M2 mRNA. The expression level of endogenous M2 mRNA in HeLa cells was detected using RNase protection assay 4 h following Trail (250 mug/ml) treatment. (C) Effect of Trail on the synthesis of endogenous M2 protein. HeLa cells were first treated with 250 mug/ml Trail followed by pulse labeling of newly synthesized proteins with [35S]methionine. M2 protein was then immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE for autoradiography as described in Materials and Methods.

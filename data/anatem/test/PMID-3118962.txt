Malate-citrate cycle during glycolysis and glutaminolysis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells.
The malate-citrate cycle was studied during aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis in a strain of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells which showed a very low malate-aspartate shuttle system activity. The experimental approach includes: estimation of mitochondrial NAD[P]+-dependent malic enzyme activity; respiratory activity of freshly harvested or fasted cells, and of isolated mitochondria; and determination of the metabolites involved in the glycolytic and glutaminolytic pathways. The results suggest that in this strain, the malate-citrate shuttle is not an effective pathway for transferring glycolytic reducing equivalents from cytosol to mitochondria. Less than 15% of the glucose uptake was affected by the 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate inhibition of the malate-citrate shuttle. Moreover, in the presence of glucose, the malate-citrate cycle did not appear to play an important role in the glutaminolytic process. The present work supports and extends the finding of previous studies, since the results showed that the glucose metabolism depressed the oxidative processes in Ehrlich ascites tumor mitochondria, not only alone, but also in the presence of glutamine. Interestingly, the high glutamine uptake was maintained in the presence of glucose.

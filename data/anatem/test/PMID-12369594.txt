Effects of 4-alkylmorpholine N-oxides on ATP-producing processes in Ehrlich ascites and L1210 leukaemia cells.
The main purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of the homologous series of 4-alkylmorpholine N-oxides on ATP-producing processes in Ehrlich ascites and L1210 murine leukaemia cells. The effects on aerobic glucose consumption, lactic acid formation, content of total (T-SH) and non-protein thiol groups (NP-SH), endogenous and exogenous respiration and the level of ATP in tumour cells incubated in vitro were investigated. 4-Dodecylmorpholine N-oxide (DMNO), one of the most active compounds, decreased the level of ATP immediately after addition to the suspension of Ehrlich cells in an ice bath. After 2 h incubation at 37 degrees C the drop in the ATP level was much lower. A possible explanation for the decrease in the ATP level might be interaction of the amine oxide with the cell membrane.

Ectopic localization of mitochondrial ATP synthase: a target for anti-angiogenesis intervention?
A receptor for angiostatin was identified on the surface of endothelial cells as F(1)-F(0) ATP synthase (Moser et al., 1999). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96, 2811-2816. This ectopic ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis and is inhibited by angiostatin over a wide pH range. Endothelial cells grown at normal pH suffer no ill effects from this angiostatin-mediated inhibition of ATP synthase, whereas endothelial cells grown at low, tumor-like extracellular pH cannot maintain a normal intracellular pH and die. Angiostatin inhibits both ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis (Moser et al., 2001) and interferes with intracellular pH regulation (Wahl and Grant, 2002; Wahl et al., 2002). Although angiostatin administered intravenously is cleared from the circulation in a matter of minutes, angiostatin-mimetics that are more stable have potential for clinical application. An angiostatin-mimetic activity has recently been observed using a polyclonal antibody against the beta catalytic subunit of ATP synthase. In order to explore the mechanism of action of angiostatin and its mimetics, further work needs to be done to evaluate clinical applicability, specificity, and contraindications for this class of therapeutics.

Tropical splenomegaly syndrome in Zambia: further observations and effects of cycloguanil and proguanil.
Nineteen Zambian patients with the tropical splenomegaly syndrome and sinusoidal lymphocytosis on liver biopsy were studied. The association of macrobulinaemia with the tropical splenomegaly syndrome has again been confirmed. Sixteen patients were treated with antimalarials-12 with cycloguanil pamoate alone, 3 with cycloguanil and proguanil, and 1 with proguanil alone. Twelve patients were observed for periods of sufficient length for the drug effect to be assessed, and in 11 there was a good response in terms of decrease in spleen size.Cycloguanil pamoate may be of value both for prophylaxis and treatment in areas where tropical splenomegaly syndrome is endemic.

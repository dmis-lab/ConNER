Antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of a protein kinase Cbeta inhibitor in human breast cancer and ovarian cancer xenografts.
In cell culture, the compound 317615 2HCl, a potent inhibitor of VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation, was not very effective against MX-1 breast cancer cells (IC50= 8.1 microM) or SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells (IC50 = 9.5 microM). Exposure to combinations of paclitaxel or carboplatin and 317615 x 2HCl with MX-1 cells in culture resulted in cell survival that reflected primarily additivity of the two agents. Exposure of SKOV-3 cells to paclitaxel or carboplatin along with 317615 2HCl resulted in cell survivals that reflected additivity of 317615 x 2HCl with paclitaxel and greater-than-additive cytotoxicity with carboplatin. Administration of 317615 x 2HCI orally twice daily to nude mice bearing subcutaneous MX-1 tumors or SKOV-3 tumors resulted in a decreased number of intratumoral vessels as determined by CD31 and CD105 staining with decreases of 35% and 43% in MX-1 tumors and 60% and 75% in SKOV-3 tumors, respectively. 317615 x 2HCl was an active antitumor agent against the MX-1 xenograft and increased the tumor growth delay produced by paclitaxel by 1.7-fold and the tumor growth delay produced by carboplatin by 3.8-fold. Administration of 317615 x 2HCl also increased the tumor growth delay produced by fractionated radiation therapy in the MX-1 tumor. Treatment with 317615 x 2HCl alone increased the lifespan of animals bearing intraperitoneal SKOV-3 xenografts by 1.9 fold compared with untreated control animals. The combination of paclitaxel and 317615 x 2HCl resulted in 100% 120-day survival of SKOV-3 bearing animals. Administration of 317615 x 2HCl along with carboplatin to animals bearing the SKOV-3 tumor produced a 1.8-fold increase in lifespan compared with carboplatin alone. 317615 x 2HCl is a promising new antiangiogenic agent that is in early phase clinical testing.

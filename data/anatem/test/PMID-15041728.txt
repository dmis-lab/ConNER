Levels of expression of CYR61 and CTGF are prognostic for tumor progression and survival of individuals with gliomas.
The biological properties of CCN proteins include stimulation of cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion, as well as angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. We quantified CYR61, CTGF, WISP-1, and NOV mRNA expression levels in samples from sixty-six primary gliomas and five normal brain samples using quantitative real-time PCR assay. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the links between expression of the CCN genes and clinical and pathological parameters. Overexpression of CYR61, CTGF, WISP-1, and NOV occurred in 48% (32 of 66), 58% (38 of 66), 36% (24 of 66), and 15% (10 of 66) of primary gliomas, respectively. Interestingly, significant associations were found between CYR61 expression versus tumor grade, pathology, gender, and age at diagnosis. Also, a significant correlation existed between CTGF mRNA levels versus tumor grade, gender, and pathology. In contrast to CYR61 and CTGF, no significant association was found between expression of either WISP-1 or NOV versus any of the pathological features. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis showed that CYR61 and CTGF expression had a significant correlation with patient survival. These results suggest that CYR61 and CTGF may play a role in the progression of gliomas; their levels at diagnosis may have prognostic significance; and these proteins might serve as valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.

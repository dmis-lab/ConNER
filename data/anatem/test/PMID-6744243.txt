Inhibition by N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate of Ehrlich ascites tumour growth and glucose transport.
N-(Phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) suppressed the growth of Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously as the growth rate decreased, the cellular uptake of glucose and the density of a class of glucose-reversible binding sites for cytochalasin B on the cell surface were also found to be reduced. There is a highly significant correlation between the magnitude of changes in the number of cytochalasin B binding sites and the magnitude of changes in glucose uptake. The physiological significance of these observations are discussed.

14-3-3zeta Overexpression and abnormal beta-catenin expression are associated with poor differentiation and progression in stage I non-small cell lung cancer. 
Recent studies have shown that 14-3-3zeta interacted with other key cellular proteins involved in the tumor development and progression. Knowledge of 14-3-3zeta and beta-catenin expression and clinical significance in the same tumor tissues is limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and significance of 14-3-3zeta and beta-catenin in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specimens of NSCLC and adjacent normal lung tissues were collected from 110 patients. The expressions of 14-3-3zeta and beta-catenin were detected by western blotting, double labeling immunofluorescence, confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The expression of 14-3-3zeta was upregulated in stage I NSCLC. Further, the overexpression of 14-3-3zeta correlated with histological grades, lymph node metastasis and poor clinical outcome. Abnormal expression of beta-catenin was significantly correlated with poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Abnormal beta-catenin expression was associated significantly with positive 14-3-3zeta expression. In conclusion, 14-3-3zeta and beta-catenin might have an important role in development, progression and metastatic process of NSCLC. 14-3-3zeta might be used as prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC.

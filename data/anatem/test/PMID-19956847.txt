ICAM-3 enhances the migratory and invasive potential of human non-small cell lung cancer cells by inducing MMP-2 and MMP-9 via Akt and CREB. 
We have previously reported that intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) is associated with an increase of cellular radio-resistance and cancer cell proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that ICAM-3 has an additional effect on cancer cell migration and invasion because molecules induced by ICAM-3 are known as regulators of cell migration and invasion. To examine this hypothesis, we used NCI-H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line (p53 and PTEN null cell) and constructed an ICAM-3-over-expressing stable transfectant, which exhibited increased cell migration and invasion. The increased migration and invasion resulted from up-regulation of expression and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9. ICAM-3 also increased Akt phosphorylation, which caused an increase in cellular migration/invasion and MMP activities. Activity of several transcriptional factors located downstream in the Akt pathway was also tested, and constitutive activation of adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) by ICAM-3 was detected. Blockage of the Akt pathway attenuated CREB activation, and a decrease in CREB expression reduced cellular migration/invasion and activity of MMPs. This result indicates that CREB functions in the signaling pathway between Akt and MMP. We also showed ICAM-3-induced cell migration and invasion in NCI-H460 NSCLC cells (wild-type p53 and PTEN cell) through the same signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that ICAM-3 stimulates cancer cell migration/invasion via ICAM-3/Akt/CREB/MMP pathway regardless of p53 and PTEN status, and this reflects the possibility that ICAM-3 could be considered as a candidate for anti-cancer drug development and as a cancer diagnostic marker.

Correlation of lymphatic vessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor with nodal metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. 
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate not only the intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatic vessel density (ILD and PLD) but also the expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and to test their correlation with regional lymph nodal metastases in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). METHODS: A clinicopathologic data review was performed in 60 patients with PTMC treated with total thyroidectomies involving neck dissections. The patterns of lymphatic vessels, the expression of VEGFs, and their correlation with neck metastases were assessed. RESULTS: PLD was significantly higher than ILD (p < .001). Patients with high PLD (>8.0) showed higher rates of neck metastases than low PLD (<= 8.0) (74.0% vs 46.8%, p = .03). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed high PLD as the only independent variable predictive of neck metastasis. The expression of VEGFs did not correlate with either lymphatic density or neck metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: PLD may be of potential benefit in the prediction of neck metastasis in PTMC.

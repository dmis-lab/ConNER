Hypocholesterolaemic and antioxidant effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Linn) in rats.
The hypocholesterolaemic and antioxidant effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra (GG) root powder were examined in hypercholesterolaemic male albino rats. A 4-week administration of GG root powder (5 and 10 gm% in diet) to hypercholesterolaemic rats resulted in significant reduction in plasma, hepatic total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides and plasma low-density lipoprotein and VLDL-cholesterol accompanied by significant increases in HDL-cholesterol levels. Furthermore, significant increases in fecal cholesterol, neutral sterols and bile acid excretion along with an increase in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and bile acid production were observed in these animals. The root powder administration to hypercholesterolaemic rats also decreased hepatic lipid peroxidation with a concomitant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and total ascorbic acid content. Thus, the hypocholesterolaemic and antioxidant effects of GG root appeared to be mediated via (i) accelerated cholesterol, neutral sterol and bile acid elimination through fecal matter with an increased hepatic bile acid production and (ii) improving the activities of hepatic SOD, catalase and increasing the ascorbic acid content. The normo-cholesterolaemic animals when fed with GG root powder at 10 gm% level, registered a significant decline in plasma lipid profiles and an increase in HDL-cholesterol content. The antioxidant status of these animals also was improved upon treatment.

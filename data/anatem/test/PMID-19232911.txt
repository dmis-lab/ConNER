An introduction to evidence-based practice for hand surgeons and therapists.
Evidence-based practice is a methodical approach to clinical practice where experience, best research evidence, and patient goals and values are integrated to make optimal decisions when making a diagnosis, selecting a diagnostic test, picking an intervention or determining prognosis.

Expression of CD154 on renal cell carcinomas and effect on cell proliferation, motility and platelet-activating factor synthesis. 
CD40 activation by CD154 may trigger diverse cellular responses, ranging from proliferation and differentiation to growth suppression and cell death, in normal and malignant cells. However, the pathophysiologic role of CD154 expressed by tumor cells remains unclear. We have investigated the expression of the CD40-CD154 system in 24 primary cultures derived from renal cell carcinomas, its correlation with tumor stage and its potential functional significance. We found coexpression of CD40 and CD154 in most of the renal carcinoma cell lines. CD154, but not CD40 expression, significantly correlated with tumor stage. Moreover, renal carcinoma cell lines also released the soluble form of CD154 into the supernatant. CD40 engagement by CD154 did not affect apoptosis or survival. On the contrary, CD154 stimulated cell proliferation, motility and production of PAF, a phospholipid mediator of inflammation with angiogenic properties. Furthermore, the renal carcinoma cell lines expressed PAF-R. Blockade of PAF-R by WEB-2170, a PAF-R antagonist, abolished the CD154-dependent motility, indicating a role for PAF synthesized after CD154 stimulation in renal carcinoma cell motility. In conclusion, this study identifies new functional properties for CD154, which are potentially relevant for the growth and dissemination of renal carcinoma cells.

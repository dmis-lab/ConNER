Methotrexate osteopathy in rheumatic disease.
OBJECTIVE:
To determine whether two adults with stress fractures receiving low weekly doses of methotrexate had methotrexate osteopathy.
CASE REPORTS:
Two adult patients developed features consistent with methotrexate osteopathy while receiving low weekly doses of methotrexate.
METHODS:
Iliac crest biopsy samples were taken and bone histomorphometry carried out.
RESULTS:
Symptoms resolved when the methotrexate was discontinued. Bone histology showed changes consistent with osteoblast inhibition by methotrexate.
CONCLUSIONS:
When given in low doses for prolonged periods, methotrexate may have adverse effects on bone, particularly in post-menopausal women.

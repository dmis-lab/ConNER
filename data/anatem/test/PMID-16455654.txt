c-Met expression is regulated by Mitf in the melanocyte lineage. 
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling is thought to be a key pathway in both melanocyte development and melanoma metastasis. Here, HGF stimulation of melanocytes was seen to up-regulate c-Met expression. In an effort to decipher the mechanism by which HGF up-regulates its receptor, we found that c-Met is a direct transcriptional target of Mitf. This was confirmed with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments of the human c-Met promoter, as well as by the ability of adenovirally expressed Mitf to modulate endogenous c-Met protein levels in melanocytes. Disruption of Mitf blocked HGF-dependent increases in endogenous c-Met message and protein levels, indicating that HGF regulates its own receptor levels via Mitf. Finally, dominant-negative inhibition of Mitf resulted in profound resistance of melanocytes and melanoma cells to HGF-dependent matrix invasion, suggesting a physiologic role for this pathway in melanocytic development and melanoma.

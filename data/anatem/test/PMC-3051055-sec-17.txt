Genes related to signal transduction
On day 7, the up-regulated genes related to signal transduction were PDE1A, MYO10, APOB, and so on, and down-regulated genes were CYTL1 and IL6. On day 14, the up-regulated genes were ANGPTL4, EPHA3, RASL10B, etc., and the down-regulated genes were CXCL12, CCL8 and VLDLR. The genes up-regulated on both days were LEP, RAC3, and RASL11B, and those down-regulated both days were MX1 and WISP2. Notably, up- and down-regulated genes PDE1A, APOB, ALCAM, PSCD4, CYTL1, and IL6 were more strongly expressed on day 7 than on day 14, while ANGPTL4, EPHA3, RAB12, CXCL12, CCL8, and VLDLR were more strongly expressed on day 14 than on day 7.

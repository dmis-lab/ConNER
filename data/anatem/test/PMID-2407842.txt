Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in canine lymphoma. 
Following an overnight fast, blood samples were obtained from 14 dogs with previously untreated lymphoma before and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes following an intravenous challenge with 500 mg/kg dextrose. Samples were assayed for glucose, lactate, and insulin concentrations and compared statistically with ten control dogs of similar weight and age undergoing an identical dextrose challenge. Dogs with lymphoma had similar glucose tolerance curves when compared with controls. Lactate concentrations were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) at baseline and all time periods of the glucose tolerance test in dogs with lymphoma when compared with controls. Rise in lactate concentrations over baseline levels in the first 30 minutes of the glucose tolerance test were significantly higher in dogs with lymphoma (P = 0.011). Insulin concentrations were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) at baseline and at the 5-, 45-, 60-, and 90-minute time periods of the glucose tolerance test in dogs with lymphoma. Rise in insulin concentrations over baseline in the first 5 minutes of the glucose tolerance test were also significantly greater in dogs with lymphoma (P = 0.021). These results indicate carbohydrate metabolism is altered in dogs with lymphoma. Many of these alterations parallel those observed in human patients suffering from cancer cachexia making canine lymphoma a potential model for further study of the pathogenesis and therapy of cancer cachexia.

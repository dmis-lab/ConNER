Scanning electron microscopy of vascular casts in experimental ocular vasoproliferation.
Scanning electron microscopy of vascular casts was used to investigate three experimental models of neovascularization. In each experimental situation, the casts provided a valuable three dimensional representation of the newly formed blood vessels and permitted subclassification of the vessels within normal and proliferating vascular networks. They defined also the predominant origin of new vessels from venules and capillaries, and enabled the evolution of proliferating vessels into arterioles and venules to be documented. Although vascular casts must be interpreted with caution in light of the possibility of incomplete filling and other artifacts, they are a valuable tool in the study of ocular vasoproliferation.

Cooccurrence of reduced expression of alpha-catenin and overexpression of p53 is a predictor of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Even though the pathological background contributes to lymph node metastasis, the biological characteristics of tumors have also gained wide attention. In this study, the expression of the cadherin-catenin complex and p53 was studied in early gastric cancer. Their correlation with lymph node metastasis and the predictability of lymph node metastases, by combining these factors, were also discussed. METHODS: One hundred and one specimens obtained from surgery were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal anti-E-cadherin, anti-alpha-catenin and anti-p53 antibodies. RESULTS: Expression of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin was reduced in 50.5 and 64.4%, respectively. p53 protein staining was positive in 29.7%. There was a significant correlation between E-cadherin and alpha-catenin expression, but no correlation was found between p53 expression and E-cadherin or alpha-catenin expression. A reduction in alpha-catenin expression and p53 overexpression correlated to lymph node metastases, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that cooccurrence of reduced expression of alpha-catenin and overexpression of p53 was an independent factor indicating lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION: A study of both alpha-catenin and p53 expression may be helpful to predict lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer.

Absence of effect of prenatal ethanol on adult emotionality and ethanol consumption in rats.
Lower peak blood ethanol concentrations after 1 and 2 g of ethanol per kg were found in pregnant rats than in virgin females. No significant differences in adult "emotionality" or ethanol consumption were found in rats exposed to prenatal alcohol and in pair-fed and untreated controls.

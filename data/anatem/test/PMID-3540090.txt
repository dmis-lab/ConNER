Antishock trousers: a collective review.
Antishock trousers have become an integral part of emergency medical care for many traumatic and life-threatening emergencies. This article represents a summary of the current state of knowledge concerning the use of this device. A brief history of the development of antishock garments is discussed. This is followed by a discussion of human clinical studies and results of clinical research on hemodynamics, respiration, use in head injury, and effects on vascular hemostasis. Indications, contraindications, complications, and recommended procedure for use are discussed. Based on randomized prospective studies, antishock garments have not, as yet, been shown to improve patient morbidity or mortality. Proper use of antishock garments requires an understanding of both their function and their limitations.

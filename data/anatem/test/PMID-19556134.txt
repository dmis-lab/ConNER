Tumour angiogenesis: its mechanism and therapeutic implications in malignant gliomas.
Angiogenesis is a key event in the progression of malignant gliomas. The presence of microvascular proliferation leads to the histological diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Tumour angiogenesis involves multiple cellular processes including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, reorganisation of extracellular matrix and tube formation. These processes are regulated by numerous pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic growth factors. Angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed to interrupt the angiogenic process at the growth factor, receptor tyrosine kinase and intracellular kinase levels. Other anti-angiogenic therapies alter the immune response and endogeneous angiogenesis inhibitor levels. Most anti-angiogenic therapies for malignant gliomas are in Phase I/II trials and only modest efficacies are reported for monotherapies. The greatest potential for angiogenesis inhibitors may lie in their ability to combine safely with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

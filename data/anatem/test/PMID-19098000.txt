The Akt/mTOR pathway assures the synthesis of HIF-1alpha protein in a glucose- and reoxygenation-dependent manner in irradiated tumors. 
Transcriptional activity of HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) has been reported to be up-regulated in solid tumors after ionizing radiation; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the response remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we performed a series of molecular imaging experiments using a HIF-1-dependent reporter gene, 5HREp-ODD-luc, and found an essential role of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Hypoxic tumor cells distant from blood vessels were dramatically reoxygenated at 24 h postirradiation, and HIF-1 activity increased as HIF-1alpha accumulated in the reoxygenated regions. The accumulation was inhibited with a nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, through the suppression of radiation-induced phosphorylation of Akt in the reoxygenated regions. Akt knockdown and an mTOR inhibitor revealed the importance of the Akt/mTOR pathway in the postirradiation accumulation of HIF-1alpha. In vitro experiments confirmed that an increase in glucose availability induced Akt phosphorylation under reoxygenated conditions and consequently up-regulated HIF-1alpha translation. Moreover, both the accelerated translation and the previously reported reactive oxygen species-mediated stabilization of HIF-1alpha protein were essential to the activation of HIF-1. All of these results indicate that Akt/mTOR-dependent translation of HIF-1alpha plays a critical role in the postirradiation up-regulation of intratumoral HIF-1 activity in response to radiation-induced alterations of glucose and oxygen availability in a solid tumor.

Cytology and Histology
For semithin sections, embryoid bodies were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4degreesC overnight, and after dehydration in ethanol were embedded in JB-4 resin (Polysciences, Inc.). 1-4-mum sections were cut with a glass knife. For cytology, the sections were stained with toluidine blue. In cell mixing experiments, the embryoid bodies were prefixed and stained for beta-galactosidase and the sections were counterstained with neutral red. Teratocarcinomas were fixed in Bouin fixative, embedded in Paraplast, and the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microphotography was with a ZEISS Axiomat microscope. Films were scanned and figures were prepared with Photoshop 5.5 software.

Epilepsy in Down syndrome: clinical aspects and possible mechanisms.
Although epilepsy is more common in persons with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) than in the general population, the mechanisms by which seizures are generated in this population have received little attention. It is likely that this increased seizure susceptibility is due to a combination of medical risk factors and inherent neurologic abnormalities characteristic of Down syndrome. In this review clinical aspects of seizures among individuals with Down syndrome were described and possible mechanisms by which the trisomy 21 brain may generate seizures were explored.

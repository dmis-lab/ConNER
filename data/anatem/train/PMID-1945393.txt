[Incidence of fungal infection in surgical diseases of the pancreas].
Recently the number of mycotic infections has increased significantly. Authors have observed 13 mycotic infections on operated patients suffering pancreatic diseases between 1984 and 1990. 9 of 13 patients had pancreatic abscesses as well. The risk factors of fungal infections are analysed. It is important to take differentiation between fungal colonisation and septicaemia caused by yeasts. Repeated microbiological examinations can promote recognising of the fungal invasion. The base of the therapy is to avoid risk factors of infections and to use antifungal medication in time.

[Tumor metastasis and the fibrinolytic system]. 
Metastatic spread of malignant tumor appears to correlate with activation of the fibrolytic system. The role of fibrinolysis in growth and metastasis was examined in Lewis lung carcinoma of mice. The inhibition of fibrinolysis or proteases decreased the primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, whereas the activation of fibrinolysis or proteases increased the number of metastatic foci in the lung. Electronmicroscopically, thrombus formation in the primary site prevented tumor invasion and metastasis formation. Plasminogen activator (PA) content of excised tumors was determined by SDS-PAGE, and major PA was found to be urokinase (UK) type. Immunohistochemical study with specific antisera was done. When tumor cells possessed a high level of UK, laminin and type IV collagen, components of the basement membrane, disappeared from tumor tissues. These findings suggest that PA through protease cascade plays a role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Clinically, patients with advanced cancer are usually in a hypercoagulable state with elevated fibrinogen, and fibrin deposition around tumor mass is a serious problem in cancer chemotherapy. UK infusion prior to 5-fluorouracil increased tissue concentration of antitumor agent. However, development of consumption coagulopathy characterized by progression from hypercoagulable state to disseminated intravascular coagulation has also been found in several cases.

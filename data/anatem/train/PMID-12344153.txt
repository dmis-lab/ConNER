Act No. 16.045  of 2 June 1989 prohibiting all discrimination that violates the principle of equality of treatment and opportunities for both sexes in all sectors of labor activity.
This Uruguayan Act prohibits discrimination in employment with respect to the following areas, among others: 1) advertising for the provision of positions; 2) selection criteria; 3) recruitment and hiring; 4) evaluation of performance criteria; 5) the right to advancement and promotion; 6) labour stability; 7) social benefits; 8) suspension and dismissal, particularly in cases involving a change of civil status, pregnancy, or nursing; 9) possibilities for professional and technical education or retraining; and 10) remuneration criteria. Reserving places for one sex because of the presence of activities in which the sex of the employee is essential for performance or to comply with international labor treaties does not constitute discrimination.  Nor do compensatory acts designed to promote equality of opportunities and treatment of both sexes in concrete situations. In cases where the provisions of this Act have been violated, specially designated judges will call the parties together and may adopt measures designed to end the situation complained of.  If they deem it necessary, the judges may institute more formal proceedings.  If the measures adopted are not carried out, the person violating the law is subject to a daily fine, as well as administrative penalties set out in Act 15.903 of 10 November 1987.  Adverse decisions may be appealed.  The state is also to undertake educative campaigns to create interest in and understanding of the problems affecting women workers, thus promoting awareness in such workers and their employers of their situation.

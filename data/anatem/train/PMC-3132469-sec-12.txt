3.1. Glucose Tolerance Test at Various Times following Dosing
DIO mice were treated with a single IV dose of CNTO 530 (0.3 mg/kg), and glucose metabolism was monitored using an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) at various times following dosing (day 1 to 35). CNTO 530 did not influence glucose tolerance 24 hours after dosing. However, a significant improvement was observed in both fasting glucose (179 +/- 29 versus 133 +/- 19 mg/dL for untreated versus treated) and overall glucose tolerance seven days after a single dose of CNTO 530 (Figure 2(b)). In a separate study, the activity of CNTO 530 was compared to a control protein that lacked the EMP-1 peptides to ensure that the observed effects were due to the peptide and not the Fc. The glucose lowering effect was not observed in the mice treated with the protein lacking the EMP-1 peptides (data not shown). Fasting blood glucose remained improved in the treated animals 14 and 21 days after CNTO530 treatment, but was similar to the untreated group after 35 days (data not shown). The area under the curve (AUC) for the glucose tolerance tests showed a significant improvement with CNTO 530 treatment on days 7, 14, 20, and 28 (Figure 2(b)). The most dramatic effect on glucose tolerance following CNTO 530-treatment was observed on day 14 where glucose was cleared from circulation by the 15-minute time point (Figure 2(a)). CNTO 530-mediated acceleration of glucose utilization was diminished but still significant by day 28 and not seen by day 35 (Figure 2(b)). Hemoglobin levels followed a similar time-dependent change, showing an increase that peaked on day 22 and returned to normal levels by day 29 (Figure 2(c)).
Similar studies were completed in lean littermate mice fed a normal chow diet. Mice (n = 7) were given a single administration of CNTO 530 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), and glucose tolerance tests were completed after 1 and 14 days. As we observed in the diabetic rodents, no significant changes were seen in glucose clearance 24 hours after dosing. However, there were significant improvements in the area under the curve in the glucose tolerance test in animals dosed with 0.3 and 0.1 mg/kg CNTO 530 as compared to PBS (22865.4 +/- 1900.2, 24478.9 +/- 1093.4, and 28773.2 +/- 1368.3, resp., mean +/- SEM). There were no dose-dependent changes in the fasting blood glucose.

Coagulation function in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. 
BACKGROUND: The coagulation function in patients with pancreatic carcinoma is abnormal and the reason is not very clear. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the coagulation function in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. METHODS: From June 2004 to December 2007, 132 patients received diagnosis and treatment in our hospital. The coagulative parameters including the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen levels were collected and studied retrospectively. RESULTS: The average fibrinogen levels in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, (476.21 +/- 142.05) mg/dl, were significantly higher than in patients with cholangiolithiasis, (403.28 +/- 126.41) mg/dl (P < 0.05). In patients with pancreatic carcinoma, the levels of fibrinogen in the group with jaundice were significantly higher than in patients without jaundice (P < 0.05). In patients who received Pancreaticoduodenectomy, Whipple's operation, the level of fibrinogen in the group with local invasiveness was significantly higher than in the group without invasiveness. The group with lymphatic metastasis had higher levels than the group without lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference of intraoperative blood loss between patients with vitamin K, (748.27 +/- 448.51) ml, and those without vitamin K, (767.31 +/- 547.89) ml (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The level of fibrinogen in patients with pancreatic carcinoma was elevated. The elevated fibrinogen level may be associated with invasiveness and lymphatic metastasis. Using vitamin K in perioperation management did not reduce intraoperative blood loss.

Gene transfer of naked DNA encoding for three isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates collateral development in vivo.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a naturally secreted endothelial cell-specific mitogen. We investigated the hypothesis that naked DNA encoding for VEGF could be used in a strategy of arterial gene therapy to stimulate collateral artery development. Plasmid DNA encoding each of the three principal human VEGF isoforms (phVEGF121, phVEGF165, or phVEGF189) was applied to the hydrogel polymer coating of an angioplasty balloon and delivered percutaneously to one iliac artery of rabbits with operatively induced hindlimb ischemia. Compared with control animals transfected with LacZ, site-specific transfection of phVEGF resulted in augmented collateral vessel development documented by serial angiography, and improvement in calf blood pressure ratio (ischemic to normal limb), resting and maximum blood flow, and capillary to myocyte ratio. Similar results were obtained with phVEGF121, phVEGF165, and phVEGF189, which suggests that these isoforms are biologically equivalent with respect to in vivo angiogenesis. The fact that viral or other adjunctive vectors were not required further suggests that secreted gene products may have potential therapeutic utility even when the number of successfully transfected cells remains low. Arterial gene transfer of naked DNA encoding for a secreted angiogenic cytokine, thus, represents a potential alternative to recombinant protein administration for stimulating collateral vessel development.

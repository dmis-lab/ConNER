Torsade de pointes during loading with amiodarone.
Torsade de pointes represents a potential complication of chronic amiodarone therapy. Several reports have emphasized the need for a loading dose in order to achieve therapeutic blood levels rapidly. We report a case of torsade de pointes following a single oral dose of amiodarone (1400 mg or 30 mg kg-1) administered after short intravenous loading for prevention of paroxysmal atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes were preceded and associated with marked QT prolongation and bradycardia. This report suggests that careful monitoring of patients undergoing oral amiodarone loading is necessary.

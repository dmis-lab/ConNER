[TESE and mTESE. Therapeutic options in male infertility due to testicular azoospermia].
Modern techniques of testicular sperm extraction (TESE) make it possible for an infertile man to father a child. The operations are standardized to a large extent and the underlying morphological alterations of spermatogenesis also appear to be sufficiently known. Current research is focused on prognostic factors for the testicular material that determine the sperm retrieval rate and success rates after in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI).TESE and microTESE are accepted standard operations for testicular sperm retrieval for IVF/ICSI. Predictions for effective sperm recovery are addressed.

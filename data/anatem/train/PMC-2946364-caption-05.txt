Effect of the deletion of IRE1alpha on the liver.
(A) HE-stained sections of the liver tissue (scale bar: 50 mum). (B) Comparison of the serum AST and ALT levels between the IRE1alpha CKO mice and the control mice. Data are expressed as mean +/- S.E.M (n = 5). (C) Quantitative PCR analysis of lipid synthesis genes in the liver of mice fed normal or high-fructose feed. Columns indicate mean and error bars denote S.E.M (n = 3). All the data were obtained from 20 weeks old male mice.

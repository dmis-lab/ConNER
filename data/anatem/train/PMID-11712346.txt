[Anesthetic management of a patient with Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome].
The Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMCS) is a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-trunk dwarfism and mental retardation. A 49-year-old male with DMCS underwent resection arthroplasty for contracture of the right hip joint under general anesthesia using thiamylal, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, and vecuronium. Although he was assumed to have difficult airway due to short neck, macroglossia, and disturbance of neck flexion, tracheal intubation was not difficult. No complications including malignant hyperthermia were observed during the 95 min of the operation.

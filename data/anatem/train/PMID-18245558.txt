Suppression of lung tumor growth and metastasis in mice by adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of vasostatin.
PURPOSE: Angiogenesis inhibitors have strong therapeutic potential as antitumor agents in suppressing tumor growth and metastatic progression. Vasostatin, the N-terminal domain of calreticulin, is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. In this study, we determined the effectiveness of vasostatin delivered by recombinant pseudotype adeno-associated virus 2/5 (rAAV2/5-VAS) as a gene therapy approach for lung cancer treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used rAAV2/5 to deliver vasostatin intratumorally or systemically in different mouse lung tumor models--subcutaneous, orthotopic xenograft, and spontaneous metastasis lung tumor models. The therapeutic efficacy of rAAV2/5-VAS was determined by monitoring tumor volume, survival rate, and degree of neovascularization after treatment in these models. RESULTS: Mice bearing subcutaneous tumor of rAAV2/5-VAS pretreated Lewis lung carcinoma cells showed >50% reduction in primary tumor volume and reduced spontaneous pulmonary metastases. The tumor-suppressive action of rAAV2/5-VAS in subcutaneous human lung tumor A549 xenograft correlated with a reduced number of capillary vessels in tumors. In the orthotopic xenograft model, rAAV2/5-VAS suppressed metastasis of A549 tumors to mediastinal lymph nodes and contralateral lung. Furthermore, treatment of immunocompetent mice in the spontaneous lung metastases model with rAAV2/5-VAS after primary tumor excision prolonged their median survival from 21 to 51.5 days. CONCLUSION: Our results show the effectiveness of rAAV2/5-VAS as an angiogenesis inhibitor in suppressing tumor growth during different stages of tumor progression, validating the application of rAAV2/5-VAS gene therapy in treatment against lung cancer.

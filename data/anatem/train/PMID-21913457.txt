[Rubella in Poland in 2009].
In Poland, 7,587 cases of rubella were registered in 2009 (incidence 19.9 per 100,000 population). According to a new rubella case definition, introduced in 2009, 7 (0.1%) cases were classified as confirmed cases, 30 (0.4%) as probable. One case of congenital rubella syndrome was reported. The incidence in men (26.6) was 1.9-times higher than in women (13.6). The highest incidence was observed in children aged 7 and 8 years (180.3 and 175.6, respectively). No rubella deaths were registered. An improvement of laboratory diagnosis of reported cases is necessary to assess the impact of 2-dose immunization implemented in 2003 on rubella epidemiology in Poland.

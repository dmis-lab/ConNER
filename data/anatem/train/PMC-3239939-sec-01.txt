Background
Eucalyptus globulus is the most widely planted species for pulpwood production in temperate regions of the world and there are breeding programs in numerous countries. There is interest in molecular approaches to breeding, particularly marker assisted selection of wood properties. QTL analysis has an important role in identifying positional candidate genes responsible for variation in wood properties. This is one approach to targeting genes which may harbour functional allelic variants (SNPs). The objective of this study was to detect and validate QTL across multiple sites and pedigrees, in order to identify genomic regions and genes affecting growth and wood properties with wide applicability in the species. We also aimed to determine the proportion of QTL which were stable in their expression across sites of contrasting productivity. Such information will be important to exploit the full potential of the impending Eucalyptus genome sequences.

Enhanced IGF-1 expression improves smooth muscle cell engraftment after cell transplantation.
The functional benefit of cell transplantation after a myocardial infarction is diminished by early cell losses. IGF-1 enhances cell proliferation and survival. We hypothesized that IGF-1-transfected smooth muscle cells (SMCs) would enhance cell survival and improve engraftment after cell transplantation. The IGF-1 gene was transfected into male SMCs and compared with SMCs transfected with a plasmid vector (vector control) and nontransfected SMCs (cell control). IGF-1 mRNA (n=10/group) and protein levels (n=6/group) were higher (P  less than 0.05 for all groups) at 3, 7, and 14 days compared with controls. VEGF was also increased in parallel to enhanced IGF-1 expression. IGF-1-transfected cells demonstrated greater cell proliferation, stimulated angiogenesis, and decreased caspase-3 activity after simulated ischemia and reperfusion (P  less than 0.05 for all groups compared with vector or cell controls). A uniform left ventricular injury was produced in female rats using a cryoprobe. Three weeks later, 2 x 10(6) cells from three groups were implanted into the scar. One week later, IGF-1-transfected SMCs had increased myocardial IGF-1 and VEGF levels, increased Bcl2 expression, limited cell apoptosis, and enhanced vessel formation in the myocardial scar compared with the two control groups (P  less than 0.05 for all groups). The proportion of SMCs surviving in the implanted region was greater (P  less than 0.05) in the IGF-1-transfected group than in the vector or cell controls. Gene enhancement with IGF-1 improved donor cell proliferation, survival, and engraftment after cell transplantation, perhaps mediated by enhanced angiogenesis and reduced apoptosis.

DNA methylation and expression of HLA-DR alpha. 
B-cell lines established from two individuals with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) express HLA-DR antigens, whereas the isogenic T-cells do not. The lack of expression correlates with a lack of detectable HLA-DR mRNA. All of the DR alpha DNA sequences detected by a cloned DR alpha cDNA probe are contained in a BglII fragment which varies slightly in size (4.0 to 4.8 kilobases) from one individual to another. In DNA from the T-cells not expressing DR alpha mRNA, all of the potential HpaII sites within the BglII fragment appeared to be methylated. In contrast, at least some of these sites were not methylated in DNA from the B-cells expressing high levels of DR alpha mRNA. Treatment of these T-cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in the induction of DR surface antigen expression, the appearance of DR alpha mRNA, and the partial demethylation of the DR alpha DNA sequences. T-cell lines established from human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus associated T-cell neoplasias, in contrast to the T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines, expressed both DR antigens and DR alpha mRNA; the HpaII sites within the BglII fragment of DR alpha DNA of these human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-positive T-cell lines were in all cases at least partially unmethylated. Uncultured peripheral blood T-cells from human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-infected individuals expressed DR antigens at a low level, and the DR alpha locus was partially unmethylated. After 48 h in culture, DR antigen expression was substantially increased, but no significant changes were observed in methylation of the DR alpha locus or in the amount of DR mRNA which was present. This suggests that expression of DR antigens also can be modulated post-transcriptionally.

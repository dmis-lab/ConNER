Aflibercept (AVE0005): an alternative strategy for inhibiting tumour angiogenesis by vascular endothelial growth factors.
BACKGROUND: Aberrant angiogenesis is a landmark feature in cancer, which is important for proliferation, growth and metastasis, and is mediated by various pro-angiogenic factors. The VEGF pathway is one of the most important and best-studied angiogenic pathways. Inhibition of this pathway may provide clinical benefits to cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: Strategies to inhibit the VEGF pathway, including antibodies to VEGF, antibodies to the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2, decoy receptors for VEGF and tyrosine kinase inhibitors of VEGFRs, are summarized. METHODS: This review outlines and compares the latest development of these strategies, with emphasis on aflibercept, a novel decoy fusion protein of domain 2 of VEGFR-1 and domain 3 of VEGFR-2 with the Fc fragment of IgG1. RESULTS: Aflibercept was shown to have early clinical activity. Multiple studies are ongoing to determine the clinical benefits of aflibercept in cancer patients.

[Preliminary results of observing 18 cases of retinoblastoma carried within the international research program RICS].
In the years 1988-1989, the Ophthalmological Clinic in Cracow took part in the International Research Programme on Retinoblastoma as one of 28 clinical centres in 14 countries. The study included 18 children with retinoblastoma, in most cases in the advanced stadium of the disease. As a rule, the eyes filled with tumours were enucleated, and the less advanced cases were treated with combined methods applying radiation with 60Co plaques with xenon arc photocoagulation, cryopexy, and chemotherapy. In 18 treated children 23 eyes were enucleated (in 5 children both eyes, in 6 children with bilateral retinoblastoma 1 eye, and 7 eyes in all unilateral cases). Six eyes with less advanced lesions were treated with combined methods. One child died because of metastases to the brain. The obtained data reveal that retinoblastoma is diagnosed too late, which decreases the chance of cure and causes great danger for the life of the child.

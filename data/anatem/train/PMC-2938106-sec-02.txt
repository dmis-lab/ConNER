Study Population
This prospective longitudinal study was conducted at the University of British Columbia and was approved by the human research ethics board at that institution. All subjects who received a renal transplant from January 2005 to December 2007 were invited to participate, and those who agreed and signed consent forms were enrolled in the study. Patients were followed routinely at the transplant center, and blood and urine samples were obtained prior to and serially post-transplant at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks; then every 6 months through year 3; and also at the time of suspected rejection. Graft biopsy tissue was obtained pretransplant and at the time of all biopsies performed post-transplant. Blood samples from normal healthy controls served as reference samples. Samples from cases, controls, and comparators were treated identically.
All rejection episodes were diagnosed by conventional clinical and laboratory parameters, confirmed by biopsy, and graded according to the Banff 97 working classification of renal allograft pathology (28). Banff categories 2 and 4 (antibody-mediated or acute/active cellular rejection) were considered significant. Category 3 (borderline change) was only considered significant if associated with graft dysfunction and treated for rejection. All baseline demographic and follow-up data were recorded in the transplant program electronic database, and there was no loss to follow-up during the period of study.

Duplicated HGT candidates in K. thermotolerans.
(A) Part of the conserved synteny block surrounding KLTH0C07700g and KLTH0C07722g tandem genes. Same legend as Figure 3A. (B) Part of the conserved synteny block surrounding KLTH0F12276g gene. Same legend as Figure 3A. (C) Sequence alignment of proteins from K. thermotolerans and K. waltii. (D) Phylogenetic tree reconstructed from sequence alignment of 100 sites of K. thermotolerans protein family members, K. waltii gene, bacterial (green) and amoebal (blue) proteins. Bootstrap values are indicated next to the nodes and branch length scale is shown at bottom left.

On the mechanism of glycolysis stimulation by neutral detergents in 3T3 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. 
Glycolysis of 3T3 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was greatly enhanced by Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 at about 100 micrograms/mg cell protein. This enhanced glycolysis was partly sensitive to rutamycin and partly sensitive to ouabain, suggesting that the detergent released the control of the ATPase of the mitochondria and of the plasma membrane Na+K+-ATPase. Nonidet P-40 had no effect on glycolysis in cell-free extracts from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells to which soluble mitochondrial ATPase was added. Measuring ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux and using ouabain-sensitive lactate production as a measure of ATP hydrolysis by the Na+K+ pump, it was shown that Nonidet P-40 greatly decreased the efficiency of the Na+K+ pump. Quercetin increased the efficiency of pumping in EAT cells both in the absence and presence of the detergent.

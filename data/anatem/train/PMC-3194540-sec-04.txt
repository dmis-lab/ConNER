Conclusions
This is the first prospective evaluation of parents' preferences in newly diagnosed juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients participating in the BeSt for Kids trial. Within the limitations of the small amounts, patients clearly preferred initial combination therapy with etanercept and disliked taking prednisone. After actual exposure and follow up, this questionnaire will be repeated to see if preferences remain the same.

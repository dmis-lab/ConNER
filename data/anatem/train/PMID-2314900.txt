Overexpression confers an oncogenic potential upon the eph gene. 
The eph gene encodes a putative receptor tyrosine kinase for an as yet unknown ligand. Some human cancer cells have been found to overexpress eph mRNAs without gene amplification. We show here that NIH3T3 cells acquire tumorigenic ability in nude mice and make colonies in soft agar with a viral LTR (Long Terminal Repeat)-driven artificial expression of the eph gene to a high level. This result supports the alleged contribution of overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases to cell transformation.

Sensitivity variation in two-center holographic recording.
An experimental study of variation of sensitivity with recording and sensitizing intensities in two-center recording is presented. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. It is shown experimentally, for what is to our knowledge the first time, that the sensitivity is a function of the ratio of recording to sensitizing intensities and not the absolute intensities. Also, the ratio of recording to sensitizing intensities should be small to obtain high sensitivity values. We also report the highest sensitivity (S=0.15 cm/J) that has been achieved to date for a LiNbO3:Fe:Mn crystal.

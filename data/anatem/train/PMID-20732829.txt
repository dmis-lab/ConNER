Using a web-based orthopaedic clinic in the curricular teaching of a German university hospital: analysis of learning effect, student usage and reception.
PURPOSE:
Modern teaching concepts for undergraduate medical students in Germany include problem based learning as a major component of the new licensing regulations for physicians. Here we describe the usage of a web-based virtual outpatient clinic in the teaching curriculum of undergraduate medical students, its effect on learning success, and student reception.
METHODS:
Fifth year medial students were requested to examine 7 virtual orthopaedic patients which had been created by the authors using the Inmedea-Simulator. They also had to take a multiple-choice examination on two different occasions and their utilisation of the simulator was analysed subjectively and objectively.
RESULTS:
One hundred and sixty students took part in the study. The average age was 24.9 years, 60% were female. Most of the participants studied on their own using their private computer with a fast internet-connection at home. The average usage time was 263 min, most of the students worked with the system in the afternoon, although a considerable number used it late in the night. Regarding learning success, we found that the examination results were significantly better after using the system (7.66 versus 8.37, p<0.0001). Eighty percent of the students enjoyed dealing with the virtual patients emphasizing the completeness of patient cases, the artistic graphic design and the expert comments available, as well as the good applicability to real cases. Eighty-seven percent of the students graded the virtual orthopaedic clinic as appropriate to teach orthopaedic content.
CONCLUSION:
Using the Inmedea-Simulator is an effective method to enhance students' learning efficacy. The way the system was used by the students emphasises the advantages of the internet-like free time management and the implementation of multimedia-based content.

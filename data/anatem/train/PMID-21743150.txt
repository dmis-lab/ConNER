[Expression of Merlin protein in non-small cell lung carcinoma and the clinical significance]. 
OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression and clinical significance of Merlin protein in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The expression of Merlin protein in 45 cases of NSCLC and adjacent tissue of NSCLC and normal lung tissue was checked by immunohistochemistry. The relation between the expression of Merlin protein and the multiple factors of pathological type, gender, P-TNM stage, differentiation and lymph node metastasis was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression rates of Merlin protein in NSCLC and normal lung tissue sections were 73.33% and 15.56%, respectively (P<0.05). The expression of Merlin protein was not associated with the pathological type, gender, P-TNM stage, differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Merlin protein might contribute to the initiation of metastasis of NSCLC.

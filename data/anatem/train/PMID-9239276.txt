[Treatment of acute liver failure in children].
Among the main causes of acute liver failure (ALF) in children, metabolic diseases (especially in infants), viral and toxin or drug induced hepatitis are the most frequent. The cause remains, however, undetermined in about 30% of the cases. Management must be conducted in a pediatric hepatology unit or intensive care unit in relation with a pediatric transplant team in order: 1) to perform urgent etiological diagnosis; 2) to initiate specific therapy and symptomatic treatment; 3) to evaluate the severity and prognosis of liver disease for selection of children for emergency liver transplantation; 4) to evaluate contraindications to liver transplantation. The overall survival of post-emergency liver transplantation for ALF in children averages 65%.

Expression, regulation, and function of IGF-1, IGF-1R, and IGF-1 binding proteins in blood vessels.
The vascular insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 system includes the IGFs, the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and multiple binding proteins. This growth factor system exerts multiple physiologic effects on the vasculature through both endocrine and autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. The effects of IGF-1 are mediated principally through the IGF-1R but are modulated by complex interactions with multiple IGF binding proteins that themselves are regulated by phosphorylation, proteolysis, polymerization, and cell or matrix association. During the last decade, a significant body of evidence has accumulated, indicating that expression of the components of the IGF system are regulated by multiple factors, including growth factors, cytokines, lipoproteins, reactive oxygen species, and hemodynamic forces. In addition, cross-talk between the IGF system and other growth factors and integrin receptors has been demonstrated. There is accumulating evidence of a role for IGF-1 in multiple vascular pathologies, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis, angiogenesis, and diabetic vascular disease. This review will discuss the regulation of expression of IGF-1, IGF-1R, and IGF binding proteins in the vasculature and summarize evidence implicating involvement of this system in vascular diseases.

Effects of dietary folate on ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in the interleukin 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient mice. 
Folate supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer in subjects with chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). The interleukin (IL) 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient (IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null)) mice spontaneously develop colon cancer in the setting of chronic UC. This study investigated the effects of dietary folate on the development of UC-associated colon cancer in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. Weaning IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice were randomized to receive 0 (deficient; n = 40), 2 (basal requirement; control; n = 46), or 8 (supplemented; n = 36) mg folate/kg diet for 32 weeks. At necropsy, all macroscopic colonic tumors were identified and histologically classified as dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The incidence of high-grade lesions (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma) in the folate-supplemented group was 46% lower than that in the control group (35.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.009). The incidence of high-grade lesions in the folate-deficient group was also 49% lower than that in the control group (33.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.007). The higher mortality rate in the folate-deficient group compared with the other two groups (25% versus 6.5% and 5.6%, P < 0.02) partially accounted for the low incidence of high-grade lesions in this group. These data indicate that dietary folate supplementation at 4x the basal dietary requirement significantly suppresses UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. These data also suggest that folate deficiency may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis in chronic UC. However, the high mortality observed in the folate-deficient group precludes a definitive conclusion concerning the effect of folate deficiency on UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in this model.

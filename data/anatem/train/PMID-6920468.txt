Relationship of self-concept during late pregnancy to neonatal perception and parenting profile.
Thirty-one gravidas were studied to examine the relationship between a woman's feelings about herself during late pregnancy, her perception of her newborn, and her profile of parenting. The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale was completed during the third trimester of pregnancy, the Neonatal Perception Inventory I at one-to-two days postpartum, and the Neonatal Perception Inventory II and the Michigan Screening Profile of Parenting at four-to-six weeks postpartum. When considered separately, no positive significant relationships were found between scores on these variables. However, all subjects with negative scores on both self-concept and neonatal perception had negative scores on at least two subscales of the parenting profile.

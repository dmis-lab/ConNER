Tumor microenvironment, a dangerous society leading to cancer metastasis. From mechanisms to therapy and prevention.
Cancer is no longer considered by scientists just a jumble of mutated cells. To grow, invade and metastasize, a treacherous society between cancer and host cells must be formed, and this association provides novel and effective clinical targets for cancer control and prevention. This collection of reviews at the front-edge of scientific knowledge focuses on host-tumor cell interactions, the disastrous consequences they can produce and approaches the ways to break up these cellular conspiracies, to leave the tumor cells unattended and vulnerable.

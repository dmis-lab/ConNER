Medical therapy for intermittent claudication.
Medical therapy to improve symptoms, stabilise the underlying vascular disease and improve lower limb outcomes is an important and effective adjunct to lifestyle modification and surgical or endovascular interventions in patients with IC. Randomised placebo controlled trials have shown that the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor cilostazol 100mg bid improves pain-free and maximum walking distance, as well as quality of life, in a range of patients with intermittent claudication in whom there is no evidence of tissue necrosis or rest pain. This review summarises the evidence from 8 pivotal trials of cilostazol involving over 2000 patients with intermittent claudication treated for up to 6 months. There is comparatively less evidence to support the use of other treatment modalities for relief of symptoms in intermittent claudication, but there is considerable interest in therapeutic angiogenesis to promote new vessel formation and enhance collateralisation of the lower limb using recombinant growth factor proteins or gene transfer strategies. The rationale for therapeutic angiogenesis is discussed, together with the most recent results from randomised trials in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

Loss of body weight after challenge-infection with WNV.
Mice (n = 8) were vaccinated intranasally with Flu-NA-DIII (*) or Flu-NA-GFP (o) or by the subcutaneous route (^ and ^, respectively). The daily weights of each animal were calculated compared to their respective weight on the day of challenge, and data are shown as the average percentage of initial weight for each group. Error bars represent the standard error for all samples available at that time point. Subsequently, the mice were challenged subcutaneously with 106 TCID50 WNV-NY99 and weighed daily. The mean body weight is expressed as the percentage of the body weight before challenge infection (A). The survival rates of mice after challenge infection with WNV-NY99 are depicted as Kaplan-Meier survival curves (B). The difference in survival rate between Flu-NA-DIII and Flu-NA-GFP vaccinated mice was statistically significant as determined by the logrank test. The symbols for the respective groups are the same as in panel A.
